The simple answer is none, dont get me wrong Im not against going to college but the reality is successful insurance agents come from all walks of life. When I ask agent that have gone to college and are now insurance agents what they would have done differently, they all say the same thing, I wish I would have skipped college and just got into the business. That being said if youre thinking about being an insurance agent find a good mentor that is willing to teach you how to become successful. Ive ran into too many individuals who have gotten out of insurance as fast as they have gotten in because they didnt take the time to find the right person or agency that would teach them the math behind the machine that make you successful.

The program does provide a good base knowledge of insurance and the products out there, but it was more along the lines of how an insurance company operates versus how an agent or agency would operate. I would recommend a business degree or something along those line, although not required most of the time to become an insurance agent.\n",

The specific concentration of study is not necessarily that critical as agents come from all sorts of different backgrounds. If you have graduated with a degree in Insurance or Marketing as your college or university may offer, that is certainly a plus, but not in my experience a requirement. My Bachelor's Degree is in Political Science for example.\n",

Education is a wonderful experience that no one can ever take away from you. However, there are many successful insurance agents without degrees who found great mentors in our industry. One thing to consider is unless you have a full scholarship or deep pockets to pay for this degree, measure the cost versus use in our industry. I believe you will find a hard time justifying the high cost of college versus the reward of a degree in an industry that does not require a degree to be hired or become successful. Just my two cents.\n",

      "5 Well, what is the best major to have to be an insurance agent? First let me qualify this by saying you don't have to have a college degree to be an agent, nor is there really a major to become an insurance \"agent\". You can do several business type majors that would work perfectly for working on the company side of insurance. Finance, computer science, math, accounting and so on would work for the company side. For the agent side? A bit different. I guess I can tell you what my choices were from college. Originally a accounting/computer science major who in my 4th year decided to switch to marketing and industrial psych. The business background helped because when you are an agent you are in business for yourself and really by yourself. So understanding overhead, management, advertising are all pluses. However, I have the most mileage from the industrial psych classes. Industrial psych is workplace psych where you study why people do what they do at work. That education has helped me greatly as insurance sales as an agent really is about forming relationships and trust if you want a long term business relationship. Just remember no matter what you do, if you go into this business there will be people that love you and people that don't. Try and focus on those who love you and let somebody else have those that don't. Honestly there is enough to go around.\n",

      "6 That's a great question! Selling insurance doesn't really require any particular field of study to help you be successful. While having a degree in a business or marketing related field can help, what you really need to be successful won't be learned behind a desk. To be successful you need to be empathetic, caring, and a good listener. You need to be able to put the needs of a client above your desire for commissions. You need to be able to foster and maintain relationships, and you need to be able to persuade someone that you are the answer to their problem. That comes from within, not a classroom.

Some people have coverage that extends to the locality where they live, or the state in which they reside. Coverage outside of that specified area can be highly limited. The issue becomes more severe with most plans when you travel overseas. If your current coverage is inadequate to cover potential difficulties secure a travel insurance policy. Personally, I travel overseas frequently and never purchase travel insurance.\n",

      "8 I am going to make a different assumption from Julie on this and go with a travel MEDICAL insurance plan vs. auto. Travel medical insurance is designed to supplement your major medical or Medicare plan when you travel outside the United States. Most major medical plans have worldwide coverage but there are some expenses that are not covered by major medical. These would include med evac, translation of medical records and return of mortal remains. Some Medicare Advantage plans have out of country coverage but if you have original Medicare your out of country coverage is limited. It would be wise to purchase an international travel medical plan.\n",

      "9 If your car is the unfortunate victim of vandalism, will your current car insurance policy cover the claim? The answer to this question depends on the type of auto insurance coverage you currently carry. If you only carry the minimum liability limits, the answer is no. However, if you carry comprehensive coverage, the answer is yes less any applicable annual deductible you have selected for your policy. Vandalism to your vehicle could include a variety of incidents; key scratches, broken glass and other damage caused with malicious intent. Vandalism is different than burglary. If something was removed from your vehicle as a result of the vandalism, you must be sure to state this in your report. In most cases, comprehensive coverage will cover both theft and vandalism. The amount of coverage your policy offers depends not only on the overall type of policy you have selected, but the coverage limits, the type of claim, and your chosen annual deductible. In the case of high deductible policies, it may be more beneficial to pay for the repairs out of pocket than to run it through your insurance company. Before any claim will be paid, you must file a report with your local police department describing the nature of the vandalism.\n",

      "10 There are many types of travel insurance plans from trip interruption due to an illness or emergency to medical or accidental death while traveling. Like any insurance policy it is a transference of risk. If you are taking a $10,000 family vacation and $8,000 is already paid as non refundable and if you had an emergency and had to cancel last minute and you would not miss the $8,000, don't buy insurance. However, if you or a family member were to become ill or injured in a foreign country, could you pay the tens of thousands of dollars it may cost for stabilization care and emergency medical transport. Most people could not. The cost of travel insurance for medical care and emergency evacuation or medical transport back home to the US is almost nothing compared to the risk of cost. My answer would be yes every time.\n",

      "11 It is my opinion that the agent plays a more important role than the company. The agent is the one who will advise you on setting limits.

      "Why should I buy insurance from an agent rather than directly from the insurance company?\n",
      "12 The simply answer is that an experienced independent insurance broker works for you and your interests for free. We have access to multiple carriers and can shop unbiased for your best option to meet your unique needs. If you purchase direct from an insurance company, you get one best option and chances are not your best option. The companies you are familiar with advertise and market heavily. That cost is passed on to you as a consumer. Brokers have access to companies you are not familiar with who do not have large marketing budgets and ultimately have more affordable premiums for the same coverage.\n",

      "13 This is an outstanding question! It goes to the heart of how best to protect your family, and sort through all of the choices out there. It can be scary trying to figure out who has the 'best deal' and since most people don't understand a lot about insurance, how not to get taken. I think it is fair to say also that people don't have a high opinion of insurance to begin with, so agents aren't seemingly much better. So why not just choose a policy from an on-line company or name brand company? Here's what I'd say to you. I have always done business as much by my feel for the person as by their product. If my server doesn't care about me or my meal, I don't go back to the restaurant, or I only order carryout from them. If a bagger at the grocery store just throws my groceries haphazardly into the bags, I'll look for a different line every time. I want to know that the person I'm dealing with cares about me, and my business. I also want to know that I have some flexibility - if they're the only bagger or server, I won't go back to those places. An independent agent can offer more options than a name brand office agent would. The name brand can only offer that companies policies, and prices. If their policy is the best one, and I feel the agent truly cares about me and my needs, I'll buy from them. Chances are though, I've met with at least one other independent agent (one not tied to a single brand name - I myself work with several) to shop prices and coverage before deciding. Again, how they presented themselves to me as they worked for my business was as much a consideration for me as the policy details. If I didn't feel like they cared about anything but the sale, I'd leave, and thank them for their time. When the time comes that I need help (and it inevitably does) I want someone who cares and jumps to help, not someone who has to hunt to figure out who I am. i guess for me, I want a relationship with my business people, (and my clients) not just a transaction. I hope that helps you, and I thank you for asking!\n",

      "14 If a particular product that you need is offered by both direct and agency channels, you certainly are free to choose. However, and of course I am a bit biased because I am a Lisenced Insurance Professional who has served his clients and community for 30 years, it is my opinion that taking advantage of the professional services, advice and counsel offered by a local agent adds value and better protects you and your famil from dangerous gaps in coverage.\n",

      "15 With many companies, an agent is required before they will take your application. And many people get declined, get a policy they did not understand, or pay more than they need to pay when they decide to apply on their own. It does not cost any more premium to use an agent, and the services an agent provides can be very valuable. There is one more reason to use an agent to apply for a policy. When an agent points you to the most affordable life insurance for your health and age, your agent will not make any income from that advice unless you apply through him/her. Obviously, agents cannot make a living just giving out free advice. And again, it costs no more for you to apply through the agent - in fact, it could save you a lot of time, money, and frustration to let your agent guide you through the application process. Thank you for asking - that was a great question.\n",

      "16 When you buy from a company you'll get acceptable advice, I have little doubt. What you won't likely get is advice from someone who knows where you live on a personal basis. You'll also probably never get to speak to the same person twice because service by the company isn't assigned to one person but a phone boiler room full of inbound call clerks. You're not likely to get advice that is based upon actual experience but is learned from the sterile depictions in a text book. In a nutshell, it is hard to make a call center accountable when something goes wrong with your coverage. On the other hand, I learn to help you avoid problems when I also get to experience the problems our customers encounter. In effect you get the collective experience of 1000's of my customers. Plus, no phone clerk has the incentive I have to help you get insurance right! We're certainly not perfect but an agent might be the best thing that comes with a policy. By the way, the Ohio Dept of Insurance has just come out publicly with a recommendation to buy insurance from an agent. I happen to agree.\n",

      "17 I always recommend using an independent insurance agent who can compare multiple insurance companies instead of just one carrier. Agents who work for a specific carrier are known as \"captive agents\" and must apply through that carrier before they can look at other companies (and usually they can only look at other carriers if they were declined by the first company). There's no extra cost to using an independent agent versus calling the carrier directly and you get all of the added services at no charge (instead of getting a random customer service representative to try to answer your questions. Through an agent, you can speak with the same person for all your questions and get any input that you need. Applying through an agent can save you tons of time, aggravation, and frustration through the application process - and of course, they can save you a lot of money by determining for you which insurance company may offer the coverage at the lowest possible cost. Often times when you try to ask 10 different people for help, you can have too much information thrown at you and the process can become confusing. When you're looking for coverage, stick with an agent who you feel is knowledgeable, experienced, and will help you determine how much coverage is suitable to your needs and which carrier will offer it at the lowest possible cost based on your medical history. I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact me for help with your coverage and if you have any other questions. Thanks very much.\n",

      "19 What is the amount for a modified endowment contract for the 2014 tax year? Unfortunately, you are mixing your investment or plan up. There is no annual guideline for a Modified Endowment Contract. You are thinking of qualified money contributions and confusing the two. Determination of a modified contract is something that can occur at any time if the extra monies applied to a policy trigger a formula known as the 7 pay test. When extra money is suggested to be added to a policy, the insurance company performs the 7 pay test on those funds and determines if the addition of those funds will trigger a MEC, before the funds are applied. More often than not,a deposit of extra funds triggers a MEC at some future date. If that's the case, the policy does not become aMEC until that date. So money could sit and grow for several years, even decades without becoming a MEC. As the policy draws closer to the MEC date, simply taking money out of the policy can eliminate the MEC. There are several other ways to eliminate the MEC classification as well.\n",

      "24 A liability claim has a time that it is discovered and the time that it occurs. There are two basic forms of liability coverage, occurrence and claims-made. If the claim has not been initiated, some insurer might assume the risk on a claims-made basis. It is unlikely they will do that if they suspect a claim is coming. On the very esoteric side, though, there are companies that insure after a known loss. These policies are written for tax purposes.\n",

      "25 The vast bulk of general liability insurance coverage written for business is provided on an \"occurrence\" coverage form. The occurrence form of coverage is triggered by the \"occurrence\" of an event that causes a loss that is neither intended or expected on the part of the insured. If the event occurs during the policy period, it is covered without much limitation to when it is reported. On the other hand, another form of coverage is written for business that is referred to as a \"claims made\" form of coverage. Again, the trigger is the loss but now, rather than determining whether the loss occurred during the policy period, the question is when the claim first becomes known to the insured and when the claim is first made with the carrier. A claim on this form of coverage doesn't necessarily have to be made during the dates of the policy coverage for coverage to available for the loss. Claims made coverage is usually written for doctors, lawyers, insurance agents, and others where the advice and professional interpretation and expertise is the product covered. Claims made policies are designed to keep only the current policy term the only limit of liability exposed to loss. Occurrence policies have often had years and years of coverage limits stacked upon the other to create large pots of money to settle losses that may have occurred through many years. Language was added to occurrence policies to identify that a loss includes \"continuous and repeated exposures to the same conditions\" to help connect the chain of events in an accident to avoid having each event serve to be a separate loss.\n",

      "26 When your agent was talking to you in the beginning about all of your insurance needs did they ask you about the alarm system? Some but not all insurance companies will require an active alarm system to offer theft coverage on owned property. Most insurance companies will offer premium discounts on property coverage with an active, central station monitored alarm system but will not exclude theft coverage without the alarm. I would recommend that you contact your agent and ask them for a copy of your original application if you don't already have a copy. That will indicate how the alarm system question was initially answered. Also, ask your agent if your insurance company requires an alarm system to be covered for theft on your property coverage. I would do this as soon as possible. If your company does require the active alarm to have theft coverage, then you will want to get that alarm system up as soon as possible to avoid having a break in or burglary denied by your insurance company. The thing to remember is that every insurance company is different in their policy forms. I would find out about this right away from your insurance company/agent.\n",
      "If I do not have an alarm system in my business and I get broken into, will insurance policy cover any damages and losses?\n",
      "27 The long and short is answer is yes and no. If it were only that easy. There are several factors that play into premium increases due to claims. The first is the insurance company policies and underwriting. Also, what type of business are you in. Followed by the two biggest factors in premium changes due to claims, which are frequency and severity. The frequency is the number of claims that you have and how often they occur. Also are your claims predictable or are they unforeseen. Severity refers to the size or dollar amount of the claim. All of these factors and more will go into the decision to change your premium. If it is a claim that can happen again and there are no risk management procedures in place at your business, that is not in your favor. If you have a rather large claim that exceeds your premium that is also not in your favor. If you shop insurance companies every year and have no loyalty to the carrier, that is not in you r favor. If you are late paying your premium or have minimum coverage limits that can also be viewed negatively. Conversely, if you do the opposite of the above mentioned, then a single claim maybe considered a rare occurrence and not worthy of effecting your premium the following year. The best thing to do is get with your agent and discuss all the facets of the claim and what best course of action to take.\n",
      "Will Commercial General Liability Insurance Premium Go Up If We File One Claim?\n",
      "28 The copyright or trademark infringement are usually excluded from General Liability coverage. The claim, however, me be filed under personal / advertising injury. I suggest you contact a legal adviser to properly file a claim. The worst case scenario, the claim will be denied. Based on the information provided in your question, whether the carrier covers the claim or denies coverage, it is unlikely your policy premium will increase with the renewal. However, depending on your carrier's loss experience with insureds with similar to your business operations and/or number of claims filed under similar conditions, the insurance company has several remedies: - to increase rates for your class of business. That means the carrier won't debit your individual policy, instead they will increase rates for every business that provides same products or services. - to send you a non-renewal notice. The carrier simply stops entertaining coverage for you, based on the loss experience. -to exclude related exposures from future coverage. That means any future claim involving similar exposures likely won't be covered. I suppose no insurance agent is able to give you a certain answer. Because the carrier's decision on claim and future plays with many facets, including policy wording interpretation, and also based on the actuarial data of the given insurance company. A simple web search can reveal countless stories of claims denied and then accepted, bad face lawsuits, etc.\n",

This is the first claim (and hopefully last claim,) so I understand your concern about your premiums increasing next year. I'm not exactly sure what your business does, but knowing what you do would help me to further figure out whether or not your premiums would increase because of this claim. When re-marketing your account with other insurance companies we would need to explain what happened and discuss the likelihood of this happening again. Insurerslook at the historical data associated with past claims, current trends, andalso consider estimations of future losses to help determinethe rates that they use.This is a great question and thereare several things you need to consider.When you get a moment, turn to the conditions section of your CGL policy. The conditions state what your duties are in the event of occurrence, claim, or suit. 1.Notify company of occurrence a. You must see to it that we are notified as soon as practicable of an \"occurrence\" or an offense which may result in a claim. To the extent possible, notice should include: (1) How, when and where the \"occurrence\" or offense took place; (2) the names and addresses of any injured persons and witnesses: and (3) The nature and location of any injury or damage arising out of the \"occurrence\" or offense. b. If a claim is made or \"suit\" is brought against any insured, you must: (1) Immediately record the specifics of the claim or \"suit\" and the date received: and (2) Notify us as soon as practicable If you read the \"Obligations at Insureds Own Cost\"condition it says: \"No insured will , except at the insured's own cost, voluntarily make a payment, assume any obligation, or incur any expense, other than for first aid, without our consent.\" There are many questions that would need to be answered, but if I were you I would put my insurance carrier on notice that there has been an incident and let them take the reigns.

All you have to do to get a better rate is to be willing to fire your insurance company and go to one offering a better price. So I assume rates are not where you see the greed. Claims paying must be where you have the problem. We can eliminate life insurance from that discussion because you are either dead or you're not. Not much room for error there. Health insurance claims are fairly straight forward too. If you stay in your network and pay your dedictibles and co-pays...they pay the rest. Not much room for greed there.

A local agent who has been in the community for years is less likely to be deceptive, his reputation is at stake. How long has the agent been in business? Again, reputation means a lot, but don't get me wrong, new agents are honest too. It is just one factor to look at. When you receive your policy go over it with the agent and make sure the things he told you are in the policy and question anything that looks different. If you still don't have a good feeling then either turn the policy in, most have a free look provision, or get a second opinion from someone you trust.\n",

      "41 Premium taxes are generally never seen on a policy declaration page unless the carrier is a \"surplus lines\" insurance company.Surplus lines coverage is provided by a special agency type referred to as a \"surplus lines agent\" who acts as a wholesaler to retail agencies. The help non-admitted carriers manage their underwriting and administrative issues for the states where they except risk. The surplus lines agent deals with carriers who are not admitted to do business in a given state but they can also work with admitted carriers. The term \"admitted\" refers to the licensing process and a \"non-admitted\" carrier has not sought the approval of the state insurance department to provide insurance to residents and businesses of the state. When coverage is written by the non-admitted carrier, a tax is charged on the premium and fees charged by the surplus lines agency. That tax rate is 5% in Ohio. The surplus lines agent then remits the tax to the state where the risk is located. That is a part of their services. And, in answering the final part of your question, usually surplus lines tax applies to business risk but can also apply to personal lines. By the way, a non-admitted carrier is not included in the protections of the carrier insolvency protections of state statute so this is important to keep in mind when doing business with non-admitted carriers. Not being an \"admitted\" carrier in a state is not an indication of the solvency of the carrier or its ability to pay claims but it is important to mention that the protections of the law in your state may not help if a non-admitted carrier goes bankrupt in the same way as you have protection (in many instances) when an admitted carrier goes bankrup.\n",

I have several companies that I work with that will allow you to do that, and since you are young, and in good health, the premiums are pretty reasonable to start out with. If the parents have you on their auto insurance, beg them to let you stay there.

      "53 You don't. Very few colleges or universities have programs that prepare a student for a career in the insurance industry. That's not to say that a bachelor's degree would be useless, especially if it's a degree in business administration it would certainly help you understand the bigger picture of risk management and the various areas where it can apply and why. But there are many very successful people in the insurance industry that either don't have a bachelor's degree at all or have a degree in a field that was totally unrelated to insurance. Insurance carriers probably prefer candidates with a college education and in today's job market they can be choosy if it suits their corporate agenda and image. The major insurance consulting firms that deal with large businesses and complex risk management issues can certainly make the case that a bachelor's degree and perhaps even advanced degrees (MBA, PhD) are necessary for the kinds of work they do. And I'm sure some insurance agencies feel the same way. But as a 30-year veteran (admittedly college educated) very little of what most people learn in college will ever be applied in working with small and medium sized businesses and individuals on their various insurance needs. That's the kind of training you will have to get in the real world of actually learning the products of the specific segment of the insurance industry you are working in and learning from the school of hard knocks. What's really crucial in today's insurance world is that you bring the capability to continually educate yourself, learn from others and regularly update your industry knowledge and skills as the insurance world is very dynamic and evolving rapidly.\n",

Many come to the profession treating it like a sales job when in reality it is about building relationships with people and that takes time. It s not a job, but your own business and like any other business it takes a lot of hard work and determination. It is truly an investment of a persons time and money and I think many new agents don't realize this.\n",
      "Why Do So Many Insurance Agents Fail?\n",
      "57 So many insurance agents fail because this is a very hard business to be in. While from afar it looks easy, everybody looks wealthy and successful and people are just pounding upon the door demanding insurance. The reality is most people unwisely would forego carrying any insurance at all on themselves as it involves looking ahead and dealing with death. The purchase becomes \"another day, another time\" purchase. While it seems everybody needs coverage, very few pursue it, so it falls upon the insurance agent to make the case to the individual as to why they need coverage. The hard part about insurance is you can't taste it, drive it or feel it, at the end of the day, it is simply a promise to pay. It is a very hard thing to sell in reality. Agents fail because it is a difficult business and too many treat it like a sprint, rather than a marathon. A great amount of energy is expended quickly, along with resources with results that take a while. Most payments to agents take about 90 days after the application is taken. It's a business that requires patience and a budget, the reason most agents fail is they lack either.\n",

      "58 I concur with everything my colleagues have said above, but there is an additional factor. The failure rate is high because the hiring practices of most of the large companies are innately flawed. The large company agencies go a bad job of screening applicants to cull out the ones who are not likely to succeed. Their theory is that more bodies selling means more business, knowing full well that most of those people will not succeed. This flawed hiring practice compounds the training problems described above by dmrozek. The trainers are forced to train only the very basics. If a better job were done in the hiring process, there would be fewer new hires but they would be those with true potential. Because there would be fewer new hires, the trainers would have the time to provide more in depth training.\n",
      "Why Do So Many Insurance Agents Fail?\n",
      "59 I have a bit of a different opinion about this. I believe most agents fail because they aren't trained correctly. I've been doing this since 1991 and explored many company's training programs. In that time, I haven't seen them change. Do you think the market has? Insurance companies spend thousands of hours and millions of dollars training their agents on products, business plans, and sales skills. I've consulted with new agents from some of the biggest companies in the country that were on the verge of failure. They did exactly what they were trained to do and they were failing miserably. These are some bright, knowledgeable sales professionals. You know what their companies told them to do? Buy leads and call them, buy more leads and call them. If that doesn't work, you're not calling enough. Can you believe it? When you find something that's not working enough, do it more. I believe that the reason agents fail is that they aren't good prospectors. They've never been trained in how to prospect or market themselves or their business. Try this, go to 10 agents, any age, any experience, and ask them what their biggest challenge is. I've asked a lot more than that and I can tell you what the overwhelming answer is: \"I don't have enough prospects to sell to\". It's the same with everyone. If you find someone who says they have enough or too many, they're service providers, not agents. I watch really smart, professional salespeople struggle at the same time I look at a guy who looks awful, sounds worse, and doesn't know anything about insurance succeed almost effortlessly. You know the difference? That last guy knows how to talk to people. Watch him, he's always talking to people and he actually listens to them and cares. Bottom line, the best prospectors are the most successful agents. As an industry, we have to begin training prospectors, not salespeople. We have to show new agents how to connect with more people and market themselves. We should spend more time training people on how to find new prospects than we do on how to sell to the prospects they don't have. I believe there's a shift coming from price driven, transactional selling back to a relationship based insurance practice. If we treat our products and services as a commodity, so will the consumer. So, let's take the first step and change the way we train new agents. Let's first find agents motivated by the profession, not the money(not that the money's bad). Then, let's train them on finding good prospects. As I see it, that's the future of our profession and the companies and agencies that start doing this will be on the front of that wave while the rest try to figure out why their 50 year old training program isn't working.\n",

Do I think gun owners should carry liability insurance by mandate? Yes, I do. And I will tell you why. Accidents happen. Guns get discharged accidently, hunters and hikers are accidently shot every year. What happens when the person who has been shot, but not killed? Who pays their bills? Who covers the cost of their care? Should the person responsible be able to say, sorry I have no insurance, too bad for you. Someone already cited \"part\" of the 2nd amendment in a post. Let me add the other part, \" A well regulated Militia\". I am a well regulated insurance agent, which means I am licensed for insurance sales and required to carry \"E&O (errors and omissions) insurance\" to protect the consumer. If by accident I were to cause harm, there would be coverage to help them. It's an expense to me as I pay for this coverage.

      "Should Gun Owners Be Required To Carry Liability Insurance?\n",
      "65 That is a very interesting question! I'd guess that from an insurers standpoint, anything that they can sell a policy for would be a good thing for them. There certainly are statistics that will prove that people with guns are at more risk of gun violence or accidents than those that don't own guns, so you can be sure they could make some money. As to whether they should be able to? That is a stickier question. We require American's to have auto insurance, because the damages were far too high without it; health insurance because of the ever increasing costs of health care. I suppose for me, it would come down to the same principle - does making all gun owners have a liability policy lower the risks or costs for the majority of people like health or auto insurance does? If it deters some one who really shouldn't have a gun because of some burning need to go out and immediately use it, then I'm for it; If it helps lower medical costs/liabilities than maybe; if it doesn't do anything but cost gun owners and profit big corporations, then I'd have to pass. A very interesting question, and one I'm glad you asked. Thanks!\n",

      "66 Only politicians can decide if they want to mandate gun owners to carry liability insurance or not. A gun is not like a car insurance or health insurance that affects the lives of just about every one and liability claim may bankrupt an individual. By mandating every one to buy car insurance helps drive down the cost because the pool is larger. Gun liability insurance may be left up to the individual as opposed to being mandated by the government. Hope my humble opinion helps.\n",

      "67 This isnt really an insurance question but rather a political question. Having said that, the principle of insurance is pooling a risk that is too great for an individual to bear, that way the gun owner, in this case, would pay a relatively small premium to avoid paying a large claim. A weapon can do tremendous damage and accidental or purposeful actions involving a weapon could lead to substantial judgments.\n",

      "68 From the practical point of view only, the answer is no (but even this answer can't be separated from the politics as much as I would like). I suspect that your question is hinged in some political viewpoint so I will avoid the political implications. Now, should people insure for the liability they have the potential to create? In that case, I say YES. It is common sense from how I think. That said, however, most gun owners I know and have insured during my career are law-abiding, conscientious citizens and they buy liability insurance that will likely apply in one extent or another to non-intentional events with a gun and these policies will likely pay the amounts and events permissible by policy language. I know of no policy language in personal liability policies that prohibits paying for injuries caused to another while hunting, or of damage to the property of others caused by non-intentional and unintended discharge of the gun. However, I would hazard to say that it wouldn't be long before carriers would react to reduce and eliminate their exposure if our politics insisted upon coverage or attempted to mandate coverage. It is well understood that the gun won't shoot without the act of some human to make it work. (Except for Google) Cars won't drive without drivers. Legal, responsible gun owners are not the people we read about in the news. Note: Applying this answer to a business or commercial enterprise is unwise and my answer was directed towards a personal application. Different answers apply in the case of a business out of necessity.\n",

      "70 They can do that if they have proof that the bill was sent out. However, you can try to resolve this with them over the phone. Also, your policy has a month grace period where it will stay in effect even if the payment is up to a month late. It sounds like the payment was over a month late. Perhaps you can reinstate your policy and switch to automatic withdrawal as a safeguard from this happening again.\n",

      "71 That is a great question! Typically when I split business, I split the commission. The reason is that I wanted the agent who shared in the business to feel that their effort in getting the business written was compensated properly, and appreciated. If the person getting you the apps knows the type of commission that you will receive for writing the business, and then receives from you a thank you and a very small fee by comparison to your commission, what is their incentive to give you more business? In our line of work reputation is everything, and having one as a person who appreciates and rewards beats the pants off one of being greedy and selfish.If you would like info on percentage splits, please inbox me.

      "72 Insurance Companies develop rates based upon historical risk research and a number of other factors. These rates for whatever product a company offers in a particular state muct be filed and approved by the state Insurance Department. Agents do not develop rates, but they apply needs based factors that ultimately result in the rate we pay for the insurance product we are purchasing. Rates can vary from company to company but not necessarily from agent to agent who is offering the same coverage from the same company.\n",

      "73 That's a great question! Many people think that there can be price differences between agents, as they assume that the agents' profits play a part in the quote. In reality, that's not the case. The agent has no say whatsoever in the price structure of the policy. The only way company A's price can be different when quoted to you by two different agents in your town would be if one included riders (additions to a policy that provide additional protections, but at an added cost). Both agents have to use the prices set by the company, and the industry's regulators. That is a great question, and I'm glad you asked it. Thanks!\n",

      "74 Rates on life insurance is the same in ever state on a per company basis. However, there are rate differences between companies. For instance, smokers can be treated more favorable by one company or another. Shopping among companies will give you the best chance of getting the best premium but will not necessarily guarrantee the lowest rate until after the client goes through underwriting and is approved under a rate class. Independent agents or brokers like myself can do the shopping and get the best rate possible.

      "75 I am aware of carriers that use different companies in their company group to offer different rates for clients that are not necessarily available to the agency distribution channel. The different distribution develop rate experience that is independent from the other and may rise or fall independently so that rates for one is higher than another. Carriers using multi-channel distribution systems where they write business directly are probably following this model if they also have an agency channel. There are some large carriers doing this and you'd recognize them if I were to blab. I don't hate them enough to out them.\n",

I would suggest using an independent broker who is able to shop multiple companies to find you the best product premium ratio for your needs.

An independent broker is able to sort through that and find your best option for your unique situation.\n",

Rates among life insurance COMPANIES, however, are DIFFERENT. That is where shopping can help, because different companies have better rates for different age groups, health conditions, and types of policies. And that is also where your agent can help you get a better rate. Some agents have more options to offer; some have more experience; some understand health conditions or product types better.\n",

      "78 I would say yes and no to this question. Yes, it is a great career and a rewarding career if you like helping individuals and families shape their financial futures. In addition to this a successful career in the financial services field requiresa person to be personable and genuinely interested in people. No, this would not be a good career choice if you were the type of person that is an introvert or has no patience. The business has to have some time to develop and involves more of a marketing approach rather than a sales approach. You must put not only your personal effort but some marketing dollars to cause your phone to ring. You must also be good at getting referrals from your clients. With all that said, a career in the insurance or financial service field is the most rewarding career that you will find and the need for good agents is growing each year. My advice is to find a good company with a great training program and one that doesn't have limits on the agents.\n",

      "79 Having been in the business for 30 years I would say yes, with certain caveats. Do not expect an easy job! A career in insurance can be frustrating and stressful at times. Do not try to start out on your own. Find a good organization that can provide training. You will need that training and help. Be prepared for long hours, a lot of phone calls, and marketing expenses. Many agents fail because they do not approach this as a business. This is actually more of a marketing job than a sales job. You have to learn to market yourself. If you do that the sales part is easy. Find a market you like and stick to it, become a professional. Don't expect a quick buck! As with any business it takes time to develop a good consistent income. Insurance is a great career but you have to be the type of person who is willing to stick it out when times get rough and put in a good honest day's work.\n",

      "80 As a semi-recent college graduate myself (2010), I'd recommend the insurance industry, even if you don't necessarily become an agent. I studied journalism, yet found myself working as a receptionist for a small independent agency right after graduation. From there, I became an underwriting assistant at a much larger company, and from there a case manager. Today, I am a social media strategist where I am able to utilize my knowledge of writing and mass media, along with my newfound knowledge of insurance products. Once you have your foot in the door (depending on where you work), you can branch out to numerous departments including IT, accounting, case management, sales, marketing, social media, etc. It's a great industry to grow in since many of the current agents/workers and baby boomers are semi-close to retirement.\n",

But my mother is a previous race car driver and has three moving violations in the past 30 days. You have a perfect driving record. Should we pay the same amount? I dont call that discrimination, I call that adjusting the risk. The insurance company calls it underwriting.\n",
      "Why Are Insurance Companies Able To Discriminate?\n",
      "83 Adding to what Scott said, insurance companies are just like all other financial institutions in that they try to operate at a profit. Forcing an insurance company to provide benefits to everyone regardless of their individual risk profile is like demanding that banks loan money to everyone under the same terms and conditions regardless of the individual's credit worthiness.\n",
      "Why Are Insurance Companies Able To Discriminate?\n",
      "84 I think Discriminate depends on how you mean it. In cases of offering a product, a carrier cannot discriminate by race. A carrier cannot discriminate beyond what the state they are doing business in allows. In some states this may mean unisex pricing or outlawing \"red lining\" in others. Any insurance plan MUST be approved by each state's department of insurance and subject to a review prior to allowing the product to be sold. An insurance carrier may be able to create separate classes within a type of policy by showing the statistical probabilities behind doing so. Women tend to live longer than men, This can be shown statistically so separate pricing can discriminate between the two sexes. This could be applied to smoking, weight, year of birth, health conditions and so on..So if an insurance company can show a statistical difference based on gathered information, they can \"discriminate\" that way \"if\" the state allows it. What they can't do is take two people who are the same in every way and deny coverage for A while taking B into the plan.\n",
      "Why Are Insurance Companies Able To Discriminate?\n",
      "85 They price their products based on risk. That's what insurance is. If you have a lot of tickets you are likely to wreck your car. You should pay more than a safe driver pays for auto insurance. You are riskier. If you have bad health, you have to pay more for health insurance and life insurance. You are more likely to be making claims on the insurance sooner. To not charge you more would require charging more to healthy people. Health insurance is changing from true insurance to an entitlement program. This will make it less costly than it is now for unhealthy people but it will raise rates for all the healthier and younger ones. It should be a good change but time will tell. But to answer your question....would YOU want to be the insurance company and charge a 16-year old male driver with three tickets the same rate as the 45-year old woman with no tickets. If you answer yes, you should open an insurance company. You will get a lot of young customers before you go broke.\n",

      "Why does it cost more to insure an employee who's paid more, for doing the same job with the same risk as an employee who's paid less?\n",
      "87 The workers compensation benefit payable to a more highly compensated individual is greater than the benefit paid to a lower paid individual. The same is true for disability insurance. The premium is general the rate times the benefit. The greater the benefit the higher the premium. All of this is dependent upon the calculation for the benefit.\n",
      "Why does it cost more to insure an employee who's paid more, for doing the same job with the same risk as an employee who's paid less?\n",
      "88 With all due respect to the answer given by the first insurance professional to answer this question, there are two different coverage angles to take into account. Let's tackle the first issue and that is of the professional or product liability. A homeowner policy will not extend itself to cover the liability that arises our of the professional services to write software or machine code that is either given away or incorporated into a commercial product offered to others. In the event of a loss of lawsuit I don't think you will find coverage and I think if a claim were to be presented a \"reservation of rights\" letter will be issued upon notification of a claim so the carrier can explore the issue prior to rejecting the loss as \"professional liability\" that is not covered in a liability section of a home insurance policy. On the other hand, many companies permit the use of the home for office related tasks and the liability exposure for pedestrian traffic onto the property and/or into the house will probably be covered when the avocation is merely a hobby. Usually the presence of this additional exposures are required to be admitted to the carrier. That said, all claims issues are ultimately compared against coverage terms and language and no one should rely on this general advice as anything other than a reminder to consult with your insurance agent for the best answer. And finally, I am aware of no coverage that is available for the hobby coder to add to a home insurance policy. It would be interesting to know if you actually work in the computer software business in your day to day paid work.\n",

This is a very technical kind of risk and would probably best be handled by a specialty company. The risk, however, is general liability, or more specifically product liability. Policies usually restrict losses to those involving personal injury or property damage. Coverage does not necessarily extend to a program that simply doesnt perform as promised.\n",

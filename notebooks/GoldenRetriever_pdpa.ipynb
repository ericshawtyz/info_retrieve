The law will provide greater clarity on the rules and liabilities for businesses hosting personal data in Singapore. This will complement Singapore's existing strengths, such as geographical location, reliability and advanced telecommunications infrastructure, to create a conducive environment for the fast-growing global data management and data processing industries, such as cloud computing, to thrive in Singapore. The law will also put in place safeguards to protect data sets, which will help facilitate the smooth transfer of data to and from jurisdictions that have enacted data protection laws, many of which place obligations on organisations to ensure sufficient protection for transfer of data overseas. These safeguards serve as an attractive draw for cloud computing and business analytics activities to be located in Singapore. Compliance with the regime also sends a positive message and builds trust and credibility with consumers. Organisations will be able to assure their customers that their personal data will be sufficiently protected. \n",
      "\n",
      "FAQ:  Organisations, General. The provisions of the PDPA were formulated keeping in mind the need to keep compliance costs manageable for businesses. A transition period was provided to allow organisations sufficient time to phase in the necessary measures to comply with the data protection regime. There may be some costs associated with complying with the PDPA, especially for businesses that have not adopted any data protection practices. Those that already have adequate data protection measures in place should not incur high incremental costs to comply with the new law.

The collection, use or disclosure of such numbers is subject to the treatment set out in the Advisory Guidelines on the PDPA for NRIC and other National Identification Numbers, i.e. organisations may not collect, use or disclose such numbers unless it is required by law or necessary to accurately establish or verify the identity of an individual to a high degree of fidelity. \n",

At the point of generation, the randomly generated data, on their own, may not be considered personal data to the organisation if the randomly generated data does not relate to any individual and is unlikely to lead to the identification of any individual. However, the randomly generated data may become personal data if the organisation obtains further information such that the individual can be identified from that data (by itself or in combination with other information that the organisation has or is likely to have access to).For example, while the randomly generated 8 digit number beginning with '8' or '9', without more information, is not personal data, it may become personal data if the organisation calls the 8 digit number and ascertains that it is a mobile telephone number that is in use.Similarly, an organisation that randomly generates a NRIC number (e.g. by applying an algorithm or using a validator to ascertain that the randomly generated number is a valid NRIC number) will be considered as having collected the NRIC number. The collection, use or disclosure of such numbers is subject to the treatment set out in the Advisory Guidelines on the PDPA for NRIC and other National Identification Numbers, i.e. organisations may not collect, use or disclose such numbers unless it is required by law or necessary to accurately establish or verify the identity of an individual to a high degree of fidelity.\n",

      " CORRECT:  Under the PDPA, an organisation may collect, use or disclose personal data only for reasonably appropriate purposes under the circumstances. Organisations should notify individuals of the purposes for the collection, use and disclosure of personal data, and seek individuals' consent for the collection, use and disclosure of the personal data unless an exception under the PDPA applies. These exceptions are set out in the Second, Third and Fourth Schedules of the PDPA respectively.In this regard, organisations shall not, as a condition of supplying a product or service, require an individual to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal data beyond what is reasonable to provide the product or service. If the organisation wishes to collect any additional personal data, the organisation may provide the individual the option of whether to consent to this.For example, an organisation selling a consumer product to individuals should not require them to reveal their annual household income as a condition of selling the product, although it may ask them to provide such personal data as an optional field. \n",

While an organisation may not obtain consent for the collection, use or disclosure of personal data that is publicly available, it may still have to comply with all other obligations under the PDPA. In particular, the PDPA provides that an organisation may collect, use or disclose personal data about an individual only for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances. In this regard, the circumstances would need to be taken into account in determining whether the purpose is appropriate. Given that publicly available personal data is already made available to the public, the PDPC recognises that for the purposes of the PDPA, it would not be practical nor useful to unduly limit the purposes for which such data can be collected, used or disclosed, unless it is for clearly unreasonable purposes, for example, the purpose is in violation of a law or would be harmful to the individual concerned.

      " CORRECT:  Generally, organisations may continue to use the personal data collected prior to the effective date of the data protection rules, unless the individual withdraws consent (if consent had previously been given) or indicates that he does not consent to such use of the personal data.  Consent will need to be obtained if the existing data is to be used for a new purpose different from the purpose for which it was collected, or if the existing data is to be disclosed to another organisation or individual, unless any exception applies. These exceptions are set out in the Second, Third and Fourth Schedules of the PDPA respectively. This includes exceptions catering to certain emergency situations, investigations, publicly available data or where the personal data is used for evaluative purposes.For example, if a company has been using its customer's personal data to provide after-sales customer support prior to the PDPA, it can continue to do so after the PDPA comes into effect, even if it did not obtain consent previously. However, if it now intends to use the same personal data for direct marketing where it had not collected the personal data for this purpose, consent will need to be obtained for such a purpose.

      "FAQ:  Organisations, Access & Correction. Organisations may charge an individual a reasonable fee for access to personal data about the individual. The purpose of the fee is to allow organisations to recover the incremental costs of responding to the access request, such as the cost of producing a physical copy of the personal data requested. To allow for greater flexibility, there is no prescribed amount of fees imposed on organisations.As organisations are required to make the necessary arrangements to provide for standard types of access requests, the costs incurred in capital purchases (for example, purchasing new equipment to provide access to the requested personal data) should not be transferred to individuals. If the organisation chooses to charge a fee for an access request, the fee should accurately reflect the time and effort required to respond to the request.\n"

Generally, organisations may continue to use the personal data collected prior to the effective date of the data protection rules, unless the individual withdraws consent (if consent had previously been given) or indicates that he does not consent to such use of the personal data.  Consent will need to be obtained if the existing data is to be used for a new purpose different from the purpose for which it was collected, or if the existing data is to be disclosed to another organisation or individual, unless any exception applies. These exceptions are set out in the Second, Third and Fourth Schedules of the PDPA respectively. This includes exceptions catering to certain emergency situations, investigations, publicly available data or where the personal data is used for evaluative purposes.For example, if a company has been using its customer's personal data to provide after-sales customer support prior to the PDPA, it can continue to do so after the PDPA comes into effect, even if it did not obtain consent previously. However, if it now intends to use the same personal data for direct marketing where it had not collected the personal data for this purpose, consent will need to be obtained for such a purpose. If the organisation wishes to use the personal data for telemarketing, it will separately have to ensure compliance with the DNC provisions under the PDPA.\n",

The DNC Registry will then indicate, on the list, whether each number is in any of the Registers. The organisation may then send its marketing messages to the numbers that are not in the relevant Registers.The organisation may rely on the DNC Registry results for up to 30 days.

      "FAQ:  Organisations, Do Not Call Registry. The DNC provisions apply to the sending of telemarketing messages addressed to Singapore telephone numbers registered with the DNC Registry. In situations where telemarketing messages are sent through smartphone applications that use a telephone number as an identifier, such as WhatsApp, such messages will be covered by the DNC provisions. Telemarketing messages sent via other technologies such as those using a mobile data connection will be treated similarly, as long as the message is addressed to a Singapore telephone number. However, some data-based phone applications do not use phone numbers as identifiers, and may use other identifiers such as email addresses instead. Telemarketing messages that are sent through such applications will not be covered by the DNC provisions.\n",

question,meta,answer
What are Coronaviruses?,Ministry of Health.,"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses causing illnesses ranging from the common cold to pneumonia (a more severe lung infection). A new coronavirus strain has been identified in Wuhan, China. The Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) has caused cases of severe pneumonia in China and cases have been exported to other countries and cities."
How does COVID-19 spread? ,Ministry of Health.,"There is human to human transmission of COVID-19. For now, the evidence suggests spread is mostly via droplets. The virus is carried within droplets emitted from an infected person over a short distance, such as when the person coughs or sneezes. If these droplets come into contact with the eyes, nose or mouth of another person, directly or indirectly through hands that have come into contact with these droplets, the other person may become infected. Members of public are advised to remain vigilant and observe good personal hygiene practices.MOH is closely monitoring the evolving situation and members of public are advised to check the MOH website for updates."
What are the symptoms of COVID-19?,Ministry of Health.,"The symptoms of COVID-19 infection are similar to that of regular pneumonia. Typical symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath."
What is the treatment for COVID-19?,Ministry of Health.,Supportive treatment is provided based on the patient’s clinical condition. No proven specific treatment or anti-viral drug for COVID-19 is currently available.
Is the disease deadly? How is this compared to SARS?,Ministry of Health.,"The situation is evolving and many characteristics of the virus and how it may affect people are still unclear. However, current information suggests COVID-19 can cause severe disease and death in 2-3% of people with the infection, especially among the elderly and those people with underlying health problems or compromised immune systems."
What is the current public health travel advisory?,Ministry of Health.,"MOH advises travellers to avoid travel to Hubei province in China, and to defer all non-essential travel to mainland China."
"If I defer my travel to mainland China, will travel insurance cover my trip cancellation, postponement of flight tickets and hotels? How do I go about seeking refund? ",Ministry of Health.,You are advised to check with your respective travel insurance providers for information on coverage and compensation.
"How are the frontline workers, e.g., airline staff, healthcare workers, checkpoint staff, protected, to make sure that they do not get sick and spread the diseases?",Ministry of Health.,"Employees working in the various sectors would have received sector specific advisories, which include measures and precautionary measures that employees and employers can take. "
"With the new H5N1 outbreak in Hunan, China, are there additional precautions that we should take?  ",Ministry of Health.,"MOH is currently monitoring the development of H5N1 outbreak in China closely. While there have been isolated reports of H5N1 avian influenza infection in humans with presumed transmission from birds, there has not been any outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza in humans or any evidence of human to human spread. Frozen and live poultry from China is not imported into Singapore. As such, the risk of any H5N1 outbreak in Singapore is low. However, members of public are advised to remain vigilant and observe good personal hygiene practices, such as washing hands with soap and water after contact with animals. They should also avoid the consumption of raw or undercooked meat. "
"Can organisations collect, use and disclose personal data (including NRIC/FIN/passport numbers) of visitors to premises for the purposes of contact tracing and other response measures in the event of a COVID-19 case?",Ministry of Health.," Organisations may collect personal data of visitors to premises for purposes of contact tracing and other response measures in the event of an emergency, such as during the outbreak of the COVID-19.In the event of a COVID-19 case, data can be collected, used and disclosed without consent to carry out contact tracing and other response measures, pursuant to sections 1(b) of the Second, Third and Fourth Schedules to the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA), as this is necessary to respond to an emergency that threatens the life, health or safety of other individuals.As organisations may require NRIC/FIN/passport numbers to accurately identify individuals in the event of a COVID-19 case, organisations may collect visitors’ NRIC, FIN or passport numbers for this purpose.Organisations that collect such personal data must comply with the Data Protection Provisions of the PDPA, such as making reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data in their possession from unauthorised access or disclosure, and ensuring that the personal data is not used for other purposes without consent or authorisation under the law.Please click here for more FAQs on PDPA."
Who should wear a mask?  What kind of mask should I wear? ,Ministry of Health.,"For the general public who are not having any symptoms at all and are well, there is no requirement to wear a mask. As a good hygiene measure, people who are not well and have respiratory symptoms should wear a mask so that they do not spread any infection to other people. Anyone who has symptoms should see a doctor as soon as possible, to make sure that they remain well. In the case of COVID-19, we know that the infection is spread through droplets. Wearing a mask will protect other people when someone with respiratory symptoms coughs or sneezes, as the mask would trap those droplets and prevent those droplets from spreading and disseminating."
Will Government be issuing masks for public? ,Ministry of Health.,"The Government will be distributing a pack of four masks to each household at distribution points. These are to be used when you are sick and need to see a doctor.From 10 February 2020 to 29 February 2020, local households that were unable to collect their masks earlier can collect them at their Constituency’s Community Club/Centres (CCs).The mask collection exercise will end on 29 February 2020. All uncollected masks will be returned to the national stockpile to ensure that our health institutions and those in need can have access to the necessary supplies."
Where and when can I collect my mask?  ,Ministry of Health.,To collect your masks:1.  Go to www.maskgowhere.gov.sg and key in your postal code to find the location and contact information of your constituency's Community Club/Centre (CC). 2.  You will need to bring your NRIC for verification.
Why don’t the Government get SingPost to distribute the masks? Why do I still need to collect them. ,Ministry of Health.,"Through collection at the RCs/CCs, we can ensure that those who need the masks get them. It reduces wastage, ensures the masks are safe and clean and also gives us the opportunity to answer any questions public may have."
Why are SCDF medical crews seen to be wearing personal protective equipment when responding to emergencies?,Ministry of Health.,"The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) may implement precautionary measures to provide protection for its ambulance medical crews when dealing with emerging infectious diseases. Ambulance medical crews will don personal protective equipment (masks, gloves, gowns, caps and goggles) when responding to cases where patients have fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. coughs, wheezing or shortness of breath), and if they have travelled to China in the past 14 days. SCDF will also decontaminate its emergency ambulances after conveying such patients to the hospitals.These are precautionary measures, and not confirmation of a case of COVID-19."
"Why do healthcare professionals use N95 mask and don full personal protective equipment (PPE), including goggles, then? ",Ministry of Health.,"When dealing with infectious diseases, healthcare workers are required to wear the personal protective equipment (PPE), including N95 and goggles, as they are in close contact with patients and their bodily fluids.As such, the PPE is needed to create a barrier between healthcare workers and the infectious agents from the patients, and to reduce the risk of transmitting micro-organisms from healthcare workers to patient(s)."
"If Singapore has enough masks, why can’t the Government release more masks from the national stockpile to retailers or distribute to households?",Ministry of Health.,"Data from cases in China suggests that the incubation period is up to 14 days.Therefore, travellers are advised to monitor their health closely for at least 2 weeks upon return to Singapore. You are advised to seek medical attention promptly if you feel unwell, and to also inform your doctor of your travel history."
"How long is the incubation period? If somebody travels to cities with confirmed cases, how many days of no-symptoms after the travel, will he/she then be considered clean and disease-free?",Ministry of Health.,"If you have recently travelled overseas, and are feeling unwell with a fever, or respiratory symptoms (such as cough, runny nose), please seek medical attention promptly. Wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of your visit, and avoid taking public transport.You may access the latest list of GP clinics through the MOH’s Directory of Licensed Healthcare Instituions or on the HealthHub mobile application, which is available on both iTunes and the Google Play Store. Healthcare practitioners have been informed and reminded to be vigilant for cases and how to manage them. All cases fulfilling the suspect case definition seen at various healthcare settings will be reported to MOH immediately and referred to hospitals for further assessment and treatment."
I would like to seek medical attention as I have a cough and runny nose and have recently travelled to the countries with confirmed cases of COVID-19. Should I go to the GP or do I have to go to A&E? ,Ministry of Health.,Contact tracing will be conducted to identify close contacts of the confirmed cases. 
Can MOH provide more information about the whereabouts of the confirmed cases? What if I suspect that I have been at the same place as the confirmed cases? What should I do?,Ministry of Health.,"There is no need to avoid places where suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been. The risk of infection from transient contact, such as in public places, is low. There is also currently no evidence widespread sustained community transmission. Members of public are advised to adopt good personal hygiene practices, such as washing your hands frequently with soap, and wearing a mask if you are unwell.NEA has been liaising closely with, and providing support to, residents and owners of premises, to ensure that the cleaning and disinfection of areas are done in accordance with NEA’s guidelines. For places exposed to confirmed cases, NEA has also been giving advice and supervising the cleaning and disinfection works. In addition, NEA has issued sanitation and hygiene advisories to premises and facilities with high public access like hotels, commercial buildings and F&B outlets, including hawker centres.Please click here for guidelines on environmental cleaning and disinfection of COVID-19 in non-healthcare premises and in residences."
My friend sent me a message to avoid a certain location as there has been a suspected case reported. Should I be concerned?,Ministry of Health.,"Persons served with Quarantine Orders (QO) are required to stay in their designated location at all times within the allocated quarantine period. They will not be allowed to use common facilities within the Government Quarantine Facility (GQF). There will also be no visitors to the QO persons, and food/ necessary supplies will be delivered to them.There are also security measures in place to ensure compliance to GQF guidelines. Thus, persons served with QO will not able to mingle with the larger population around them. All staff working at the GQF are also provided with personal protective equipment (PPE). GQFs also undergo rigorous cleansing and hygiene regimes according to MOH and NEA guidelines."
I stay near a Government Quarantine Facility. Should I be concerned?,Ministry of Health.,"There is a difference between a Leave of Absence (LOA) and a Quarantine Order (QO).A QO is a directive issued to individuals under the Infectious Diseases Act and thus have legal force with severe penalties for non-compliance. It is far more stringent than a LOA.A QO is issued to quarantine or isolate an individual who is, or is suspected to be, a carrier or contact of an infectious disease. This is with the aim of limiting the spread of the virus in the community. It is a legal order under the Infectious Diseases Act, with severe penalties for non-compliance. Quarantine usually occurs in the home but can also be served in dedicated Government Quarantine Facilities (GQFs) or hospitals, should the individual not have suitable accommodation in Singapore.An LOA is a precautionary measure. We urge those who are on LOA to be socially responsible and comply with the LOA, to prevent possible transmissions of infections.Please refer to the Health Advisory for Persons Placed on Leave of Absence - 01 Feb 2020 for more details. "
What is the difference between being issued a Quarantine Order and being under a Leave of Absence? ,Ministry of Health.,"As part of the enhanced measures to limit the risk that travellers from China pose to Singapore, the following groups of people will be placed on Leave of Absence (LOA):"
[Updated] Who will be put under Leave of Absence (LOA)?,Ministry of Health.,"As part of the enhanced measures to limit the risk that travellers from Hubei Province pose to Singapore, the following groups of people will be quarantined:"
Who will be issued a Quarantine Order (QO)? ,Ministry of Health.,"With effect from 1 February 2020, 2359H, all new visitors with recent travel history to mainland China within the last 14 days will not be allowed entry into Singapore, or to transit through Singapore.For updates on border control measures in response to COVID-19, please click here."
Who will not be allowed to enter Singapore? ,Ministry of Health.,"All travellers are advised to avoid travel to Hubei province in China and to defer all non-essential travel to Mainland China.You are advised to seek medical attention promptly if you feel unwell, and to also inform your doctor of your travel history. If you have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit."
I am returning to Singapore from overseas (not Mainland China). Do I need to quarantine myself?,Ministry of Health.,"Employees who are served a Quarantine Order (QO) will be deemed to be on paid sick leave. The period of absence from work would be treated as paid hospitalisation leave, as part of the employees’ hospitalisation leave eligibility under their employment contracts or agreements.  Please refer to this advisory by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM).  "
I am employed. Does being under a Quarantine Order (QO) utilise my quota for medical leave or hospitalisation leave?,Ministry of Health.,"Those under quarantine are not supposed to come into contact with others in order to avoid the possibility of the spread of virus through person-to-person contact. Hence, those in quarantine will need to be isolated from and cannot physically interact with others living in the same premises.  A home quarantine package with basic necessities will be provided to individuals who have been quarantined.  You should also monitor your temperature and report your health status at least 3 times a day, and inform your Quarantine Order (QO) Agent if you feel unwell or need any assistance.  Should your household members display symptoms associated with the virus, they will need to be taken to a hospital and treated as suspect cases."
What must I do when I am being quarantined? How will it affect my household members?,Ministry of Health.,"Individuals under quarantine will be monitored by video calls at least three times a day.Spot checks will be carried out to ensure that they strictly adhere to these conditions under the Isolation / Quarantine Order (QO) during the period specified. If they are found to be non-compliant, the Director of Medical Services may require them to wear an electronic tag or order that they be detained and isolated in a hospital or in any other suitable place. It is an offence if they do not comply with the conditions listed in accordance to the QO."
How will those who are under quarantine orders at home be monitored? ,Ministry of Health.,"Persons under quarantine must not leave their designated location for any reason. Should they require assistance for daily needs beyond what is provided for under the home quarantine package, they should also arrange with their relatives / friends to purchase groceries and assist in their daily needs whenever necessary. If they urgently need to leave their place of isolation / their home for matters needing personal attention which cannot be postponed, they must first seek the permission of the Quarantine Order (QO) Agent.Spot checks will be carried out to ensure that they strictly adhere to these conditions under the Isolation / Quarantine Order during the period specified. If they are found to be non-compliant, the Director of Medical Services may require them to wear an electronic tag or order that they be detained and isolated in a hospital or in any other suitable place. It is an offence if they do not comply with the conditions listed in accordance to the Quarantine Order."
"If I need to go out to attend to urgent matters, what should I do?  What will happen if I break quarantine?",Ministry of Health.,"Persons issued with a Quarantine Order are individuals assessed to have had close contact with a confirmed case, and they are generally well and have no symptoms.We would advise you to monitor your health closely. If you have fever, cough or runny nose, wear a mask and seek medical attention promptly. Call the clinic ahead of your visit and inform the doctor of your symptoms as well as your travel history, if any."
I have been in recent contact with someone who has been issued a Quarantine Order (QO). What should I do?,Ministry of Health.,"The Quarantine Order Allowance is set up to mitigate financial impact for those who have been served Quarantine Orders. When they have completed their quarantine order, claims of $100 per day can be made by self-employed Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents, and by employers of Singapore-registered companies whose employees under QO was a Singaporean Citizen, Permanent Resident or Workpass Holder.Please refer to this factsheet for more information.  You can also approach your QO agent for further queries.  "
[Updated] I heard that people who are served a Quarantine Order (QO) will receive $100 a day under the Quarantine Order Allowance (QOA). Is that true? ,Ministry of Health.,"A Quarantine Order (QO) agent will get in touch with your employee if he/she has been issued a QO.  Your employee should notify you that he/she has been issued a QO. You can only apply for the Quarantine Order Allowance (QOA) after your employee has completed the quarantine/  The person under quarantine will receive the QOA form at the end of the quarantine and pass it to the employer.  This is to ensure that he/she has fully compiled with the QO, under the Infectious Disease Act.  The employer can then submit the form to MOH for processing.  Please refer to this factsheet for more information.  "
I am an employer.  How do I know if my employees have been issued a Quarantine Order (QO)?  How do I apply for the Quarantine Order Allowance (QOA)? ,Ministry of Health.,"If you are unemployed, but under a Quarantine Order (QO), and need social or financial assistance, please contact your QO agent for further assistance."
"If I am unemployed, but under a Quarantine Order (QO), who can I go to for social and financial assistance? ",Ministry of Health.,"Those on LOA should remain in place of your residence. You should monitor your health closely, and seek medical attention promptly if you feel unwell, and to also inform your doctor of your travel history. You are advised to minimise visitors to your residence, and maintain a record of people you come into contact with. You should also avoid crowded places and minimise contact with others.Please refer to the Health Advisory for Persons Placed on Leave of Absence (LOA) for more details.It is not necessary for household members to be segregated from the person placed on LOA, and you can continue to share the same room/apartment. But household members are encouraged to reduce interaction and minimise contact with persons placed on LOA.Please refer to the Advisory for Individuals Sharing Residential Spaces with Persons on Leave of Absence (LOA). "
What must I do when I am on a Leave of Absence (LOA)? How will this affect my household members?,Ministry of Health.,"There is as yet no evidence of widespread sustained community transmission. The four local cases are indicative of limited local transmission as they had a link to travellers from China even though they did not have any recent travel history to Mainland China. One case was a close contact of a case within the cluster of four, while three of the four cases had prolonged contact and interactions with recent travellers from Mainland China. Pending confirmation from the Chinese authorities, we understand that two members of this group of travellers were confirmed with the COVID-19 infection."
"With the four cases of local transmission, do we have a community transmission now?",Ministry of Health.,Widespread community transmission occurs when there are multiple cases or clusters where the source of infection cannot be identified. Limited local transmission occurs when cases are linked to a common source of infection that has been identified.
What is the difference between widespread community transmission and limited local transmission?,Ministry of Health.,"Individuals assessed to be a close contact of a confirmed case will be contacted and placed on quarantine. The risk of infection from transient contact is assessed to be low.If you have visited the shop and are feeling unwell, please minimise contact with other persons, wear a mask and visit your nearest GP. Please also call the clinic before you visit. For further queries, please call our hotline at 1800 333 9999."
Do I need to be quarantined if I had visited the same shop/ Yong Thai Hang that was frequented by the Chinese tourists? ,Ministry of Health.,"Contact tracing will be conducted to identify close contacts of the confirmed cases.If you are deemed to be a close contact of a confirmed case, you will be contacted by MOH officials and advised on the measures that you should take. Close contacts are defined as: (i) anyone who had provided care for the patient or have had close physical contact; (ii) anyone who had stayed at the same place as a confirmed case. The health status of all close contacts will be monitored closely for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient. Those who develop symptoms will be brought to the hospital via a dedicated ambulance for further assessment.Transient contacts can be described as anyone who had interacted with the confirmed case for short periods of time, such as passing by each other by the corridor or being on public transport or public spaces. The risk of infection from transient contact is assessed to be low."
I am a neighbour of one of the confirmed cases. What should I do?,Ministry of Health.,"No, this advisory applies only to those who have travelled to mainland China."
Does this advisory also apply to persons who have travelled to the Special Administrative Regions under China?,Ministry of Health.,"Travellers who transit in an airport in mainland China are not considered as having travelled to mainland China. Therefore, they are excluded from this advisory."
Are persons in transit at airports in China excluded from this advisory?,Ministry of Health.,"No, you are not under quarantine orders. You may leave your place of residence to attend to urgent matters, but are strongly advised to minimise your time spent in public spaces and to avoid social contact."
Am I under quarantine orders?,Ministry of Health.,"You are strongly advised to comply as a precautionary measure to prevent transmission of disease in your workplace, place of education, or to members of public. Employers and employees have a joint duty to ensure that the employee behaves responsibly during the leave of absence. MOM reserves the right to take action against the employer or employee, if they fail to discharge their duty. Employers can refer to the MOM website for the latest advisories."
"Given that this is only an advisory, can I not comply to the guidelines stated?",Ministry of Health.,"Yes, they may continue with their daily activities as they did not travel to mainland China and do not fall under this advisory."
Will my family members and friends who did not travel with me be able to attend work or school?,Ministry of Health.,"Yes, your family members may continue to live with you. However, you and your family should observe good personal hygiene practices (refer to guidelines). If you become unwell, avoid contact with your family members and seek medical attention immediately."
Can my family members continue to stay with me during this time? Are they at risk of infection? ,Ministry of Health.,"Seek medical attention if you are unwell. Please wear a surgical mask before leaving your residence and avoid taking public transport. Please inform the staff and doctor of your travel history. Your doctor will assess your health and may refer you to hospital if further assessment is necessary. If you are subsequently admitted and tested positive for COVID-19, you will be treated in an isolation room, until you are well enough to be discharged."
What will happen if I am unwell? Will I be isolated if I turn out to be a confirmed case subsequently?,Ministry of Health.,"Yes, this advisory applies only to persons returning from mainland China. However, you should minimise contact with persons under LOA. Those on LOA and others who are living together should continue to monitor your health, observe good personal hygiene and seek medical attention if unwell."
"My flatmates/ tenants have just returned from mainland China. Can I still carry on with my daily activities (e.g. work, school)? ",Ministry of Health.,Person who have returned from mainland China are advised to inform their employers or schools regarding their travel history. This is so that your employer or school can provide the necessary assistance to facilitate your leave of absence.
Do I need to declare to my employers/schools regarding my travel history? ,Ministry of Health.,"Diagnostic testing is available for symptomatic individuals who are admitted to hospital on suspicion of infection. If you develop fever, cough or breathlessness, or are feeling unwell, you should wear a mask and seek immediate medical attention at any outpatient clinic. Your doctor will assess and refer you to the hospital if necessary."
"If I am worried about my status (whether or not I am infected), can I go to hospital / National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) to get tested? ",Ministry of Health.,"Diagnostic testing is available for symptomatic individuals who are admitted to hospital on suspicion of infection. It is therefore not useful to send employees who do not have symptoms to the doctor/ hospital for testing. Such individuals will not be offered diagnostic testing, and will be asked to return home."
Can I send my employees/ students to the doctor to get tested at the end of the 14-day LOA period so that they can be cleared to come back to work/return to school?,Ministry of Health.,"Health advisories and latest information on the local disease situation is available on the Singapore Ministry of Health website at www.moh.gov.sg. For queries, please call the MOH general enquiry hotline at 6325 9220. For the latest global disease situation, you may wish to refer to information on the World Health Organisation website at www.who.int."
Can someone live in the same room as a person on LOA?,Ministry of Health.,"While you can live in the same room as a person on LOA, you are encouraged to reduce interaction and minimise contact with a person on LOA. For example, avoid sharing a bed, limit the time spent together at common areas within the apartment, have separate meal times, ensure that the room has proper ventilation etc."
Can persons on LOA share the same toilet as other occupants in the same household?,Ministry of Health.,"You are advised to avoid sharing the same toilet where possible. If it is not practical to do so, avoid using the toilet at the same time and clean toilet surfaces more frequently. You may also wish to allow some time to pass between toilet usage, in order to allow any remaining water droplets after showers to settle to the ground. Sharing the same roll of toilet paper is safe as long as the toilet roll is not stained, soiled or wet.Sharing of towels is not advised."
I operate a dormitory. Do I need to segregate a person on LOA from other occupants of the dorm?,Ministry of Health.,"While persons on LOA can stay in the same dormitory room as others, where possible and practical, measures to minimise contact between a person on LOA and other occupants are encouraged. Examples of these could include separating belongings of workers to minimise overlapping circulating space, having separate meal times, ensuring proper ventilation, etc.Sharing of beds is not advised."
"With the move to DORSCON Orange, what measures are MOE taking?",Ministry of Education.,"We have further enhanced our measures by suspending all inter-school activities and external activities until the end of the March school holidays. These include the National School Games and learning journeys. This is to help schools minimise prolonged exposure of students to the public and reduce intermingling of students across schools. This is on top of the precautionary measures that are already in place to minimise congregation of students in large numbers. These include: 
Suspension of large group and communal activities such as assemblies, camps and mass celebrations
Staggered recess times
 School-based CCAs and after-school programmes may continue but in smaller groups.   "
Why is my child sent home when he does not seem to have a fever? How are schools assessing if a child is unwell? How is MOE aligning these practices across schools?,Ministry of Education.,"Schools conduct temperature-taking exercises daily. If a child’s temperature is 38 degrees Celsius or higher, the school will contact the parents to ask that he be taken to see a doctor. Schools also look out for other flu-like symptoms such as cough and runny nose, and will suggest to the student to see a doctor. There are also times when a child may inform his teacher that he is unwell, even though he may not be running a fever or showing symptoms. In these cases, we hope students and parents can all play their part and practise social responsibility by seeing a doctor first before coming to school. Students should return to school only when they have fully recovered.   "
"Will mass events involving staff and stakeholders, such as activities with Parent Support Groups and Alumni celebrations, continue? What measures will be put in place?",Ministry of Education.,"Mass events with staff and stakeholders, but not involving students, can continue. Schools will also put in place visitor management measures, such as temperature screening and travel declarations, to safeguard the well-being of participants. MOE will advise external organisers using our school premises to do the same and take the necessary precautions.   "
Why implement the social distancing measures now?,Ministry of Education.,"We are constantly reviewing our measures to protect our schools and students, and update them based on the evolving situation and risk assessment. Before 4 February 2020, all of the confirmed cases were imported ones, with no local transmission. The announcement on 4 February by MOH of a few cases with no travel history to China marked a new phase of local transmission. Hence, MOE decided to stop mass events in schools like assemblies and camps.  Given that there is no evidence of community spread as yet, there is no need to stop mass events but we are taking precautions for vulnerable groups, such as pre-schools and school children.   "
What MOE is doing is not fool proof. What more can we do to protect our students?,Ministry of Education.,"No measure is 100% fool proof or guaranteed, but we will take the necessary precautions to contain and manage the risks, while enabling life to go on. There are two key threats we face in such an outbreak situation. First is the virus itself. We have various measures based on medical evidence that are targeted at limiting its spread. Second which is more insidious, is fear. It prevents us from doing the things we love to do and have to do. We must remember that to be deprived of our daily lives and activities – to study, learn, play, socialise with friends, visit places we like, help people in need – over a prolonged period will make life miserable for everyone and disrupt society. In tackling fear, we must as a society be resilient. We should not let fear of the virus get the better of us and prevent us from going about our daily lives. We should stay vigilant and calm, cooperate as a society, do our part and be socially responsible. Some of the most effective measures are in our own hands – wash them regularly with soap and water, and keep them away from our faces so that we reduce the risk of infection to ourselves and our loved ones, help to contain the threat, while allowing life to go on as normally as possible.   "
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared a public health emergency of international concern over the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Should we review the precautionary measures that are in place in our schools?,Ministry of Education.,We review measures and closely monitor the situation constantly. We will take the necessary precautionary measures as the situation evolves. But we all can and should continue to do our part to protect ourselves by adopting good hygiene habits and practising social responsibility by seeking medical attention if we are unwell.   
Can schools provide hand sanitizers in all classrooms?,Ministry of Education.,Personal hygiene is indeed important. But hand sanitizer is not necessary if we wash our hands thoroughly and regularly with soap. Some individuals may also be sensitive to sanitizers. Toilets in our schools and IHLs are well stocked with liquid soap. We will also be stepping up the cleaning of toilets to ensure they are clean.   
Do the precautionary measures by the Ministry of Education (MOE) also apply to tuition and enrichment centres?,Ministry of Education.,"Tuition and enrichment centres are private entities. Nevertheless, we strongly urge them to exercise the same responsibility and take reference from the measures MOE has instituted.   "
Why not close schools when DORSCON was changed to Orange?,Ministry of Education.,"DORSCON Orange means we need to take more precautions, because there are now a few cases of community spread.  In fact, many of the measures schools have taken are already DORSCON Orange measures. Closing school will disrupt many lives. We don’t rule it out when required, but it is a major, major decision. One thing to consider is that even if all students stay at home, there is no guarantee against infection. Lots of infections happen at home actually. It is also unrealistic to expect older kids to stay at home. They will go out and inter-mingle. See this interesting article: https://www.mothership.sg/2020/02/japan-family-virus-experiment/ On the other hand, in schools, we have suspended large gatherings to reduce inter-mingling drastically. There is also a tight regime of personal and group hygiene. Should there be wide community spread, which we hope will not happen, schools can be one of the safest places in Singapore against the COVID-19 virus. We will continue to monitor the situation closely, in the best interest of our students.   "
Can schools be one of the safest place for students?,Ministry of Education.,"Staff and students are already on extra alert. We are calling on all our teachers and staff to help make this happen. Hygiene is a major determinant of risk of transmission, so personal and group hygiene standards have been raised.  There is constant supervision (for the younger students) and reminders for all students to wash their hands properly and regularly, avoid touching their faces.  As a group, students will clean up after use. In terms of activities, we have scaled down all mass activities, to minimise inter-mingling.   "
Can we be assured that there will be no infection in school?,Ministry of Education.,"We have posed ourselves this difficult question, which deserves an honest answer.  We cannot ensure that there will not be any infection if we close all schools, neither can we guarantee that there will not be any infection by keeping schools open. If there is wide community spread, chances are some students may be infected. But we will certainly do our best to make schools one of the safest environments in that scenario.   "
"Even if schools are safe, how about the journey to and from school?",Ministry of Education.,"Our public transport operators will maintain high standards of cleanliness and hygiene too.  But as commuters, we should also play our part.   Remind your child to wash his or her hands with soap before the journey, and not to touch their faces.  When they are in school, they will be reminded to wash their hands with soap again.   "
Why are schools still continuing with CCAs and PE lessons? ,Ministry of Education.,Schools will take appropriate steps for CCAs and PE lessons to ensure that group sizes are small to limit any risk of transmission. We want schools to continue with as many of their usual learning and activities as possible. They are ready to step up their measures if need be.    
"Will all swimming lessons be cancelled? What about pool-based CCAs, such as Swimming, or Water Polo?",Ministry of Education.,"All external school activities will be suspended until the end of the March school holidays. Pool-based CCAs that require students to travel to swimming pools outside of their school compound, such as Swimming, or Water Polo, and programmes like SwimSafer, will be suspended.   "
"Why not delay the opening of schools for 7 or 14 days, like what Hong Kong did?",Ministry of Education.,"We had considered this, took advice from medical experts, and concluded that it is not necessary to do so, because there is currently no evidence of widespread sustained community transmission. Ours is a different situation compared to Hong Kong's. Hong Kong is closer to the epicentre of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and is closely connected to Mainland China. The number of students and staff returning from Mainland China are likely to be many times ours. We assessed that the number of students and staff returning from China recently is manageable, and a 14-day Leave of Absence (LOA) will be more targeted, while allowing schools to open and life carry on as normally as possible, which is an important aspect to safeguard in an emergency situation.   "
I heard of cases where students travelled to China and did not declare. How do we ensure that everyone does the responsible thing?,Ministry of Education.,"If you come across cases where the person didn’t declare his or her travel to China, do let the school know and they will follow up with checks. We had received some feedback on such persons, but upon further checks, we found that they had returned from China in Dec 2019. This is well over the incubation period, so the Leave of Absence (LOA) will not apply to them.  Since we announced the LOA measure, we have received more travel declarations as people return from the Chinese New Year public holiday. As of 29 Jan 2020, we have about 960 students and staff on LOA.   "
How are schools supporting students on LOA with their studies?,Ministry of Education.,"It involves a variety of methods; it need not be confined to e-learning or learning with computers. Schools will plan and implement a home based learning programme that best suits the lessons and the needs of their students. For example, schools may inform their students on specific pieces of homework or readings from their textbooks. Sometimes, for subjects like Art, hard copy packages may be dropped off at the student’s home by the school. Schools may also ask students to go through online materials in the Singapore Student Learning Space or the Learning Management Systems. Teachers will also be able to monitor the students’ learning progress through these systems.   "
I understand that primary school and MOE Kindergarten students who are close contacts of Persons Under Quarantine (PUQ) also need to observe a Leave of Absence (LOA). Why is this necessary?,Ministry of Education.,"The Home Quarantine Order (HQO) is issued to healthy persons who have recently returned from Hubei, and for those in close contact with a confirmed case. There may be young children living in the same household, and being young, they may be not be so aware of the precautions they need to take to protect themselves when staying with someone on HQO. So we have decided to take the step of issuing LOA to these young children as an additional precautionary measure. This will give their fellow students and parents added assurance.   "
"What if students or staff who are on LOA do not stay home, and move around in public areas?",Ministry of Education.,"There is a difference between an LOA and a Quarantine Order (QO). A QO is served to healthy individuals who have a higher risk of exposure to the virus, such as someone who has close contact with an infected person.  QOs have legal force, with severe penalties for non-compliance. Quarantine usually occurs in the home but can also be served in dedicated Government Quarantine Facilities (GQFs) or hospitals, should the individual not have suitable accommodation in Singapore. An LOA is also issued to students and staff who are healthy, but have recently travelled to Mainland China. So it is a precautionary measure. Although LOAs are not legally binding, we strongly urge those on LOA to be socially responsible and comply with the LOA, to prevent possible transmission of infections. The students and staff on LOAs are not required to stay at home and be isolated at all times. During the LOA, students and staff are expected to: 
Remain contactable at all times
Remain in the place of residence as much as possible
Minimise visitors to the place of residence
Minimise time spent in public places and contact with others
Monitor their health and their temperature
(For Students) Follow their home-based learning plan closely to continue with their learning

"Are vendors, canteen staff, freelance coaches also covered under the LOA measure?",Ministry of Education.,"Yes. The LOA provisions cover teaching staff, non-teaching staff, such as administrators, and other non-school staff, including canteen vendors, security guards, KCare and Student Care Centre staff.   "
"How about students and staff who did not come back from China recently, but had relatives from China visiting them?",Ministry of Education.,"As explained earlier, the LOA is a precautionary measure.  Like all precautionary measures, we have to decide how wide to cast the net.  If we include those who have visitors from Mainland China, the same logic should apply to those whose friends or families have recently been to China.  The net can grow exponentially wide.  So we decided to apply the LOA directly to those who have visited China.  Those who have close contact with people on LOA should closely monitor their health and adopt good hygiene practices. Those who feel unwell should seek medical assistance.   "
What if students or staff do not declare their travel history?,Ministry of Education.,"We urge them to spare a thought for others and do so. Their friends and families, if they know about their travels, should also urge them to do so. All of us play a part in ensuring the safety and well-being of ourselves, our loved ones and our society. We should do the responsible thing and declare our travel history, and see a doctor if unwell. Ultimately, we can only overcome this virus with the co-operation and public spiritedness of everyone in Singapore.   "
Why do we allow university dorms to be designated as Government Quarantine Facilities (GQFs)? Will allowing this put the wider student population at risk?,Ministry of Education.,"Currently, there are three university hostels designated as Government Quarantine Facilities (GQFs) – designated blocks at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Prince George's Park Residences, Nanyang Technological University's (NTU) Graduate Hall 1, and Singapore Management University's (SMU) Blk 83 Prinsep St. They have always been part of the Government's national contingency plan for a disease outbreak. We are getting them ready to be on standby, should the number of people served with QO goes up. The designated hostels will only be primarily activated when a student in our educational institutions or schools is required to serve QOs and does not have suitable accommodation. Persons served QOs are required to stay in their designated rooms at all times within the allocated quarantine period.  They are not allowed to use common facilities within the GQF.  There will be no visitors, and food and all necessary supplies will be delivered to them. There are also security measures in place to ensure compliance to GQF guidelines. All staff working at the GQF are also provided with personal protective equipment, such as masks, as advised by the Ministry of Health (MOH). GQFs also undergo rigorous cleansing and hygiene regimes according to MOH and National Environment Agency (NEA) guidelines. In other words, the persons will not be mingling with the larger population around them. "

What is personal data?,"Organisations, General
","Personal data refers to data, whether true or not, about an individual who can be identified from that data; or from that data and other information to which the organisation has or is likely to have access.This includes unique identifiers (e.g. NRIC number, passport number); photographs or video images of an individual (e.g. CCTV images); as well as any set of data (e.g. name, age, address, telephone number, occupation, etc), which when taken together would be able to identify the individual. For example, Jack Lim, 36 years old, civil servant, lives at Blk 123 Bishan St 23."
When did the PDPA come into force?,"Organisations, General
","The PDPA was implemented in phases to allow time for organisations to adjust to the new law. The Do Not Call (DNC) Registry provisions came into force on 2 January 2014 and the personal data protection provisions came into force on 2 July 2014. The data protection provisions govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal data by organisations. In brief, the PDPA contains three main sets of data protection obligations:Obligations relating to notification, consent and purposeOrganisations must notify their purposes and obtain consent from individuals for the collection, use and disclosure of individuals’ personal data.Obligations relating to compliance, accountability and access and correction Organisations must make information available about their data protection policies, appoint a data protection officer, give individuals access to their personal data (upon request) and allow individuals to correct their personal data (also upon request).Obligations relating to safeguarding personal data Organisation must: (i) comply with prescribed requirements when transferring personal data outside Singapore; (ii) use reasonable measures to protect personal data; (iii) make reasonable effort to ensure the accuracy of personal data; and (iv) cease to retain personal data when no longer required.The PDPA also provides for the establishment of a DNC Registry. The DNC Registry allows individuals to register their Singapore telephone numbers to opt out of receiving marketing phone calls, mobile text messages such as SMS or MMS, and faxes from organisations. You may refer to ourwebsite for more information on the data protection and DNC provisions."
What are the objectives of the PDPA?,"Organisations, General
","The PDPA aims to safeguard individuals’ personal data against misuse by regulating the proper management of personal data. Generally, individuals have the right to be informed of the purposes for which organisations are collecting, using or disclosing their personal data, giving them more control over how their personal data is used.The PDPA also aims to enhance Singapore’s competitive advantages as a location for data hosting and management activities by strengthening Singapore’s reputation as a secure location for data and giving assurance to businesses looking for safeguards to protect sensitive data sets."
How does the PDPA benefit business?,"Organisations, General
","The PDPA will strengthen Singapore's overall economic competitiveness and enhance Singapore's status as a trusted hub and choice location for global data management and processing services. The law will provide greater clarity on the rules and liabilities for businesses hosting personal data in Singapore. This will complement Singapore's existing strengths, such as geographical location, reliability and advanced telecommunications infrastructure, to create a conducive environment for the fast-growing global data management and data processing industries, such as cloud computing, to thrive in Singapore. The law will also put in place safeguards to protect data sets, which will help facilitate the smooth transfer of data to and from jurisdictions that have enacted data protection laws, many of which place obligations on organisations to ensure sufficient protection for transfer of data overseas. These safeguards serve as an attractive draw for cloud computing and business analytics activities to be located in Singapore. Compliance with the regime also sends a positive message and builds trust and credibility with consumers. Organisations will be able to assure their customers that their personal data will be sufficiently protected."
How will the PDPA impact business costs?,"Organisations, General
","The provisions of the PDPA were formulated keeping in mind the need to keep compliance costs manageable for businesses. A transition period was provided to allow organisations sufficient time to phase in the necessary measures to comply with the data protection regime. There may be some costs associated with complying with the PDPA, especially for businesses that have not adopted any data protection practices. Those that already have adequate data protection measures in place should not incur high incremental costs to comply with the new law. The impact on Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) should also be minimal if they do not collect, process or hold on to large amounts of personal data.The costs should be viewed against the benefits of having such a law. As data protection legislation is increasingly seen as a basic feature in an economy's legal framework, the lack of a data protection regime potentially hinders the flow of information across borders, and disadvantages Singapore businesses in the global economy."
How is the PDPA different from the Spam Control Act?,"Organisations, General
","The Spam Control Act (SCA) sets out a framework to manage unsolicited commercial electronic messages sent in bulk through electronic mail, text and multimedia messaging, otherwise known as ""spam"". The SCA requires organisations to, among others, provide an unsubscribe facility within the spam message and include a header in the subject field of the message or where there is no subject field, as the first words in the message.While the SCA manages the sending of spam messages, the PDPA sets out rules governing the proper collection, use and disclosure of personal data, which would include contact information of an individual. Under the PDPA, organisations are required to obtain consent for a stated purpose to collect, use or disclose the personal data of an individual, and safeguard such data, unless exceptions apply.In addition, the provisions relating to the DNC Registry in the PDPA allow individuals to opt out of marketing messages (voice calls, SMS/MMS or fax) delivered to a Singapore telephone number. Organisations are generally prohibited from sending marketing messages to Singapore telephone numbers registered with the DNC Registry unless they have obtained clear and unambiguous consent in written or other accessible form from the user/subscriber to the sending of the message, or if the organisation can rely on the Personal Data Protection (Exemption from Section 43) Order 2013 or any other exclusions. In relation to the sending of spam messages, the PDPA applies to the collection, use and disclosure of individuals' contact information for such purposes, while the SCA governs the manner in which the spam message may be sent. These frameworks will operate concurrently."
What is 'publicly available'? ,"Organisations, General
","‘Publicly available’ in relation to personal data about an individual, means personal data that is generally available to the public. This includes personal data which can be observed by reasonably expected means at a location or an event – (a) at which the individual appears; and (b) that is open to the public.An organisation need not obtain consent for the collection, use or disclosure of personal data that is publicly available but may still have to comply with other obligations under the PDPA."
"Can an organisation collect, use or disclose publicly available personal data for any purposes?","Organisations, General
","While an organisation may not obtain consent for the collection, use or disclosure of personal data that is publicly available, it may still have to comply with all other obligations under the PDPA. In particular, the PDPA provides that an organisation may collect, use or disclose personal data about an individual only for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances. In this regard, the circumstances would need to be taken into account in determining whether the purpose is appropriate. Given that publicly available personal data is already made available to the public, the PDPC recognises that for the purposes of the PDPA, it would not be practical nor useful to unduly limit the purposes for which such data can be collected, used or disclosed, unless it is for clearly unreasonable purposes, for example, the purpose is in violation of a law or would be harmful to the individual concerned. In any case, organisations should note that their collection, use or disclosure of personal data from publicly available sources may be bound by terms and conditions imposed and enforceable by the data source."
Are public databases considered publicly available?,"Organisations, General
","Publicly available personal data refers to personal data about an individual that is generally available to the public. In some situations, the existence of restrictions or conditions for access to the database may not prevent the data from being publicly available. For example, where a database is made accessible to the public, the personal data contained in such a database would generally be considered publicly available, even if a nominal fee is payable in order to access the data.However, whilst the PDPA does not require consent to be obtained for the collection, use or disclosure of publicly available personal data, organisations are reminded to comply with all other obligations of the PDPA."
Are randomly generated data considered personal data under the PDPA?,"Organisations, General
","Personal data is defined under the PDPA as ""data, whether true or not, about an individual who can be identified from that data; or from that data and other information to which the organisation has or is likely to have access"".
At the point of generation, the randomly generated data, on their own, may not be considered personal data to the organisation if the randomly generated data does not relate to any individual and is unlikely to lead to the identification of any individual. However, the randomly generated data may become personal data if the organisation obtains further information such that the individual can be identified from that data (by itself or in combination with other information that the organisation has or is likely to have access to).For example, while the randomly generated 8 digit number beginning with '8' or '9', without more information, is not personal data, it may become personal data if the organisation calls the 8 digit number and ascertains that it is a mobile telephone number that is in use.Similarly, an organisation that randomly generates a NRIC number (e.g. by applying an algorithm or using a validator to ascertain that the randomly generated number is a valid NRIC number) will be considered as having collected the NRIC number. The collection, use or disclosure of such numbers is subject to the treatment set out in the Advisory Guidelines on the PDPA for NRIC and other National Identification Numbers, i.e. organisations may not collect, use or disclose such numbers unless it is required by law or necessary to accurately establish or verify the identity of an individual to a high degree of fidelity."
Does the PDPA apply to the sale and purchase of databases comprising randomly generated mobile numbers? ,"Organisations, General
","The PDPA applies to the collection, use or disclosure of personal data of individuals who can be identified from that data, even if that data was randomly generated in the first instance.Sellers of databases comprising randomly generated numbers beginning with '8' or '9' which have been ascertained to be in use would be considered to be disclosing personal data, and the PDPA would apply. Similarly, those who purchase and use such databases would be considered to be collecting and using personal data, and the PDPA would apply. Among other things, consent of the individual is required for the collection, use or disclosure of the personal data, unless any exception applies."
What is 'deemed consent'?,"Organisations, General
","An individual is deemed to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal data by an organisation if the individual voluntarily provides the personal data to the organisation for that purpose; and it is reasonable that he or she would do so.For example, an individual seeking medical treatment from a medical facility, such as a clinic or hospital, would voluntarily provide his or her personal data for such a purpose. He or she would be deemed to have consented to the collection and use of his or her personal data by the medical facility for that purpose."
What should organisations and individuals take note of in complying with withdrawal of consent requirements?,"Organisations, General
","There
are a number of requirements that both individuals and organisations need to
take note of. Some of these are: 
·The individual must
give reasonable notice of the withdrawal to the organisation. As a general rule of
thumb, ten business days is considered to be reasonable notice.
·On receipt of the
notice, the organisation must inform the individual of the likely consequences
of withdrawing consent. Consequences for withdrawal of consent could simply be
that the organisation would cease to collect, use or disclose the individual’s
personal data for the purpose specified by the individuals. However, if there
are other likely consequences, the organisation must also inform the individual
of those.
·An organisation must
not prohibit an individual from withdrawing consent, although this does not
affect any legal consequences arising from such withdrawal.
·Upon withdrawal of
consent, the organisation must cease (and cause its data intermediaries and agents
to cease) collecting, using or disclosing the personal data, as the case may
be, unless the collection, use or disclosure of the personal data without
consent is required or authorised under the PDPA or any other written law.
Organisations
may provide in their marketing messages a facility for individuals to withdraw
their consent (e.g. by clicking on an “unsubscribe” link within an e-mail).
Organisations are encouraged to clearly indicate the scope of the withdrawal in
such instances. Organisations are also encouraged to inform individuals of how
they may withdraw consent for matters outside the scope of such withdrawal.
In
some cases, individuals may provide organisations a general withdrawal notice
for marketing, i.e. it is not clear as to the channel of receiving marketing
messages for which consent is withdrawn. In such cases, the PDPC would consider
that any withdrawal of consent for marketing sent via a particular channel will
be considered to only apply to all messages relating to the withdrawal sent via
that channel."
What constitutes 'acting in personal or domestic capacity'?,"Organisations, General
","These are purposes to do with an individual's personal, family or household affairs. For example, when an individual keeps a database of his or her friends' and relatives' names, addresses, contact numbers and birthdates for his or her own personal use, he or she is considered to be acting in a personal or domestic capacity. His or her keeping of the database will not be covered under the PDPA."
What is 'business contact information'?,"Organisations, General
","Business contact information (BCI) refers to an individual's name, position name or title, business telephone number, business address, business electronic mail address or business fax number and any other similar information about the individual, not provided by him or her solely for personal purposes.Based on the above definition, BCI is excluded from the data protection provisions of the PDPA. Separately, please note that the DNC provisions generally apply to all Singapore telephone numbers, unless  the organisation has obtained clear and unambiguous consent in written or other accessible form from the user/subscriber to the sending of the telemarketing message, or if the organisation can rely on the Personal Data Protection (Exemption from Section 43) Order 2013 or any other exclusions."
What are data intermediaries and how are they different from other organisations?,"Organisations, General
","An organisation shall be considered a data intermediary if it processes data on behalf of another organisation. If the organisation processes personal data as a data intermediary pursuant to a contract which is evidenced or made in writing, the data protection provisions of the PDPA would impose fewer obligations on the data intermediary, namely those pertaining to protection and retention of personal data. An example of a data intermediary could be an organisation which merely provides hosting or storage of the personal data for another organisation. Separately, the Electronic Transactions Act provides that a network service provider will not be subject to any liability under the PDPA, in respect of third-party material in the form of electronic records to which it merely provides access."
Are public agencies covered under the PDPA?,"Organisations, General
","The data protection provisions in the PDPA (parts III to VI) do not apply to any public agency or an organisation in the course of acting on behalf of a public agency in relation to the collection, use or disclosure of the personal data. Public agencies include the Government, any tribunal appointed under any written law and the statutory bodies specified in the Personal Data Protection (Statutory Bodies) Notification 2013. In the handling of personal data, public agencies and such organisations acting on their behalf will be subject to the relevant internal government rules and sector-specific legislation."
Can organisations use existing feedback or enquiries channels to handle data protection enquiries and requests?,"Organisations, General
",Organisations may ride on existing infrastructure to handle data protection-related enquiries and requests.
Where can I obtain legal advice on PDPA matters for my organisation?,"Organisations, General
","If your organisation is a Small and Medium Enterprise (SME), youmay wish to consider the Legal Aid Scheme for a one-hour consultation with a qualifiedlegal practitioner from a panel appointed by the Law Society of Singapore (LawSoc) for an initial assessment on the organisation's level of compliance with the PDPA. Please refer to out webpage Help for Organisations or LawSoc's webpage PDPA Legal Advice Scheme for further details."
Does the PDPC provide legal advice?,"Organisations, General
",The PDPC does not provide legal advice. You may refer to our Advisory Guidelines which provide guidance on the manner in which the PDPC will interpret provisions of the PDPA. The guidelines are advisory in nature and do not constitute legal advice. They are legally not binding on the PDPC or any other party. You may wish to engage independent legal advice if you are in doubt.
What can I expect from the PDPC with regard to my enquiry?,"Organisations, General
","The PDPC providesonly general information and clarification to enquiries. It is important to note that the PDPC does not provide legal or specific advice to your enquiry that may require a certain standard or decision from thePDPC to be made. Our response to your query is not asubstitute for legal advice, and is not legally binding on the PDPC or any other party. You may wish to engage independent legal advice if you are in doubt."
"How much personal data can an organisation collect, use or disclose?","Organisations, Collection, Use & Disclosure
","Under the PDPA, an organisation may collect, use or disclose personal data only for reasonably appropriate purposes under the circumstances. Organisations should notify individuals of the purposes for the collection, use and disclosure of personal data, and seek individuals' consent for the collection, use and disclosure of the personal data unless an exception under the PDPA applies. These exceptions are set out in the Second, Third and Fourth Schedules of the PDPA respectively.In this regard, organisations shall not, as a condition of supplying a product or service, require an individual to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal data beyond what is reasonable to provide the product or service. If the organisation wishes to collect any additional personal data, the organisation may provide the individual the option of whether to consent to this.For example, an organisation selling a consumer product to individuals should not require them to reveal their annual household income as a condition of selling the product, although it may ask them to provide such personal data as an optional field."
What can an organisation do with respect to existing personal data collected before the effective date of the data protection rules on 2 July 2014?,"Organisations, Collection, Use & Disclosure
","Generally, organisations may continue to use the personal data collected prior to the effective date of the data protection rules, unless the individual withdraws consent (if consent had previously been given) or indicates that he does not consent to such use of the personal data.  Consent will need to be obtained if the existing data is to be used for a new purpose different from the purpose for which it was collected, or if the existing data is to be disclosed to another organisation or individual, unless any exception applies. These exceptions are set out in the Second, Third and Fourth Schedules of the PDPA respectively. This includes exceptions catering to certain emergency situations, investigations, publicly available data or where the personal data is used for evaluative purposes.For example, if a company has been using its customer's personal data to provide after-sales customer support prior to the PDPA, it can continue to do so after the PDPA comes into effect, even if it did not obtain consent previously. However, if it now intends to use the same personal data for direct marketing where it had not collected the personal data for this purpose, consent will need to be obtained for such a purpose. If the organisation wishes to use the personal data for telemarketing, it will separately have to ensure compliance with the DNC provisions under the PDPA."
"How can an organisation obtain an individual's consent for the collection, use or disclosure of his or her personal data?","Organisations, Collection, Use & Disclosure
","Consent can be obtained in a number of different ways. As a best practice, an organisation should obtain consent that is in writing or recorded in a manner that is accessible for future reference, for example, if the organisation is required to prove that it had obtained consent.  An organisation may also obtain consent verbally although it may correspondingly be more difficult for an organisation to prove that it had obtained consent. For such situations, it would be prudent for the organisation to document the consent in some way."
Can an organisation require individuals to consent to the marketing of its products or services as a term or condition at the point of sign-up for a product or service?,"Organisations, Collection, Use & Disclosure
","As a good practice, organisations should generally seek individuals' consent for marketing via a distinct opt-in selection when signing up for a product or service.An organisation will not be considered to be requiring consent to market its products or services as a condition of providing a product or service, if it allows the individual to withdraw such consent and doing so will not result in ceasing of the provision of the product or service to the individual.The organisation should clearly state how the individual may withdraw consent from marketing subsequently (e.g. by providing a link or an email address for the individual to opt out).Organisations should also note that this approach to obtaining consent for sending marketing messages does not apply to sending of marketing messages via voice, text and fax where clear and unambiguous consent is required under the DNC Provisions of the PDPA."
Is the failure to opt out a form of consent?,"Organisations, Collection, Use & Disclosure
","Deeming that an individual has given his consent through inaction on his/her part will not be regarded as consent in all situations. Whether or not a failure to opt out can be regarded as consent will depend on the actual circumstances and facts of the case. Organisations are advised to obtain consent from an individual through a positive action of the individual to consent to the collection, use and disclosure of his personal data for the stated purposes."
Do organisations need individuals' consent to contact them to obtain their consent for a new purpose?,"Organisations, Collection, Use & Disclosure
","Organisations that wish to do soshould consider the following:Is the collection, use or disclosure of the personal data required or authorised under the PDPA or other laws for that purpose? If so, the organisation does not need to seek consent. Otherwise, the organisation should consider whether the individual has previously withdrawn or indicated that he does not consent to that new purpose.If the individual has previously withdrawn or indicated that he does not consent to that new purpose, the organisation should not contact him to seek consent for that new purpose. However, the organisation may seek fresh consent during any new transactionwith the individual. For example, a service provider may seek the consent of subscribers who previously indicated they did not consent to the use of their personal data for other purposes, at the point of renewal of their service subscription.Where the individual has not previously withdrawn or indicated that he does not consent to that purpose, the organisation may contact the individual to seek consent for the new purpose. However, if the new purpose involves marketing, the organisation must also comply with the Do Not Call (DNC) provisions when contacting the individual via voice, text or fax messages."
Can an organisation selling databases containing personal data to other organisations continue to do so after the PDPA comes into effect?,"Organisations, Collection, Use & Disclosure
","An organisation may use personal data collected before 2 July 2014 for the purposes for which the personal data was collected, unless consent for such use is withdrawn or the individual has indicated to the organisation that he does not consent to the use of the personal data. If an organisation intends to disclose the personal data on or after the appointed day (other than disclosure that is necessarily part of the organisation's use of the personal data), the organisation must comply with the data protection provisions in relation to such disclosure. As the sale of databases containing personal data involves a disclosure of personal data, organisations must obtain valid consent from the relevant individuals before doing so."
Do organisations need to obtain consent from their employees before disclosing their personal data for the purpose of business merger or acquisition? ,"Organisations, Collection, Use & Disclosure
","The PDPA provides for certain exceptions to the requirement to obtain consent. One of these exceptions allows organisations to collect, use or disclose personal data without consent for the purpose of “business asset transactions”, subject to certain conditions. “Business asset transaction” is defined in the PDPA and can apply to mergers and acquisitions. For example, Organisation A is a prospective buyer of Organisation B. Organisation A can collect personal data without consent (and Organisation B can disclose without consent) about B’s employees, customers, directors or shareholders if it relates directly to the business with which the acquisition is concerned. The personal data must be necessary for Organisation A to determine whether to proceed with the acquisition, and organisations A and B must have entered into an agreement that requires A to use or disclose the personal data solely for purposes related to the acquisition.For full details, please refer to the Second Schedule, paragraph 1(p) and 3 and Fourth Schedule, paragraph 1(p) and 3 of the PDPA."
Do prospective employers need to obtain consent from job applicants for the collection of their personal data from their past employers for evaluating the job applicant?,"Organisations, Collection, Use & Disclosure
","Organisations may collect, use and disclose personal data without consent where this is necessary for evaluative purposes. The term “evaluative purpose” is defined in section 2(1) of the PDPA and includes, amongst other things, the purpose of determining the suitability, eligibility or qualifications of an individual for employment, promotion in employment or continuance in employment.Hence, the evaluative purpose exception allows employers to collect, use and disclose personal data without the consent of the individual concerned for various purposes that are common in the employment context, for example:a) Obtaining a reference from a prospective employee’s former employer where necessary to determine his suitability for employment; orb) Obtaining opinions about the employee where necessary to determine his eligibility for promotion. In practice, an organisation that has been requested to disclose information about its past employee may not be able to evaluate whether it is necessary for evaluative purposes, and may therefore wish to obtain the consent of the individual."
Do organisations need consent from individuals to disclose their personal data to overseas authorities upon request?,"Organisations, Collection, Use & Disclosure
","Organisations are required to comply with the Data Protection Provisions, including the Consent Obligation and Transfer Limitation Obligation, under the PDPA for any disclosure and overseas transfer of personal data, unless an exception applies.Depending on the specific factsof the case, an exception to the Consent Obligation may apply such that an organisation may disclose the personal data to an overseas authority without consent from the individual. The circumstances for disclosure without consent are provided in the Fourth Schedule of the PDPA. The Transfer Limitation Obligation may also be taken to be satisfied where certain exceptions in the Fourth Schedule applies (more details are set out in Regulation 9(3)(e) of the Personal Data Protection Regulations 2014).However, no specific exception under the PDPA routinely covers all requests from overseas authorities.If an organisation requires further guidance from the PDPC on this matter, please write in to us at info@pdpc.gov.sg."
Do organisations have to provide notifications when CCTVs are deployed? What should CCTV notices state?,"Organisations, Collection, Use & Disclosure
","Organisations must notify individuals of the purposes for which their personal data (including CCTV footage of them) is collected, used or disclosed and obtain their consent, unless any exception applies. For example, notification and consent is not required if the personal data is publicly available. The PDPA does not prescribe the content of notifications. Generally, organisations should indicate that CCTVs are operating in the premises, and the purpose of the CCTVs if such purpose may not be obvious to the individual. Please refer to the Advisory Guidelines on the PDPA for Selected Topics, Chapter 4, on Photography, Video and Audio Recordings,and PDPC’s Guide to Notification for information and examples on good practices organisations may adopt when notifying individuals about personal data policies and practices."
Must an organisation always provide access to an individual's personal data when a request is made?,"Organisations, Access & Correction
","An organisation is required to respond to an access request in respect of personal data in its possession as well as personal data that is under its control. However, organisations are prohibited from providing an individual access to his personal data if the provision of the data could reasonably be expected to: cause immediate or grave harm to the individual's safety or physical/mental health;threaten the safety or physical/mental health of another individual; reveal personal data about another individual; reveal the identity of another individual who has provided the personal data, and the individual has not consented to the disclosure of his or her identity; or be contrary to national interest. In addition, there are cases where organisations may deny access requests. For example, organisations will not be required to provide access to personal data if it is subject to legal professional privilege, or if the disclosure of the information would reveal confidential commercial information that could harm the competitive position of the organisation. There are also exclusions for access and correction of personal data with respect to any examination conducted by an education institution, examination scripts and examination results prior to their release. Organisations may also refuse access to or refuse to correct opinion data kept solely for an evaluative purpose as defined in the PDPA. The specific exceptions may be found in section 21 and the Fifth Schedule of the  PDPA."
What personal data must an organisation provide when an individual submits an access request?,"Organisations, Access & Correction
",An organisation that receives an access request from an individual is required to provide the information requested by the individual. This may include:the individual's personal data (as specified in the request); andinformation about the ways the personal data has been or may have been used or disclosed by the organisation (as specified in the request).
Can an organisation charge a fee for access requests?,"Organisations, Access & Correction
","Organisations may charge an individual a reasonable fee for access to personal data about the individual. The purpose of the fee is to allow organisations to recover the incremental costs of responding to the access request, such as the cost of producing a physical copy of the personal data requested. To allow for greater flexibility, there is no prescribed amount of fees imposed on organisations.As organisations are required to make the necessary arrangements to provide for standard types of access requests, the costs incurred in capital purchases (for example, purchasing new equipment to provide access to the requested personal data) should not be transferred to individuals. If the organisation chooses to charge a fee for an access request, the fee should accurately reflect the time and effort required to respond to the request."
Must an organisation provide correction to an individual's personal data when a request is made?,"Organisations, Access & Correction
","Upon request, an organisation is generally required to correct an error or omission and send the corrected personal data to every other organisation to which the personal data was disclosed to within a year before the correction, unless the other organisation does not need the corrected personal data for any legal or business purpose. For example, the organisation may have disclosed a customer's name and address to a delivery company it engaged on a once-off basis to deliver a product that the customer purchased. Since the delivery has been completed, the organisation will not be required to send the corrected personal data to the delivery company.An organisation need not make a correction where it is satisfied on reasonable grounds that a correction should not be made. In this case, the organisation shall annotate the personal data in its possession or under its control with the correction that is requested but not made. An organisation is also not required to alter an opinion, including a professional or expert opinion. Exceptions from correction requirement may be found in the Sixth Schedule of the PDPA."
Can an organisation charge a fee for correction requests?,"Organisations, Access & Correction
",Organisations are not entitled to impose a fee for the correction of personal data required under the PDPA.
How long can an organisation retain its customers' personal data?,"Organisations, Care of Personal Data
","The PDPA does not prescribe the retention period of personal data. However, an organisation should cease to retain its documents containing personal data, or remove the means by which the personal data can be associated with particular individuals, as soon as it is reasonable to assume that the purpose of collection is no longer served by the retention; and retention is no longer necessary for business or legal purposes.Organisations are not required to delete or destroy a customer's personal data upon the customer's request, and may retain it as long as there is a business or legal reason to do so."
What are the rules on transferring personal data out of Singapore?,"Organisations, Care of Personal Data
","The PDPA requires that measures are taken by the organisation transferring the personal data overseas to ensure a comparable standard of protection of the personal data overseas. These measures include the use of contractual agreements among the organisations involved in the transfer conditions, for example, by ensuring that the recipient overseas is bound by legally binding obligations to provide a comparable standard of protection. These measures are set out in the Personal Data Protection Regulations 2014."
"When can organisations collect, use or disclose an individual's NRIC number (or copy of NRIC)?","Organisations, NRIC Numbers
","Organisations are generally not allowed to collect, use or disclose an individual's NRIC number (or copy of NRIC). They may do so only if it is required under the law (or an exception under the PDPA applies) or necessary to accurately establish or verify the identity of the individual to a high degree of fidelity.Organisations which collect individuals' NRIC numbers (or copies of NRIC) must be able to provide justification on request to individuals and/or the PDPC on the basis for their collection, use or disclosure of NRIC numbers (or copies of NRIC)."
What does it mean that organisations can collect an NRIC number (or copy of the NRIC) if it is necessary to accurately establish or verify the identity of an individual to a high degree of fidelity?,"Organisations, NRIC Numbers
","Organisations can collect an individual's NRIC number (or copy of the NRIC) to ensure that the individual is identified to a high degree of accuracy.Examples would be transactions that typically relate to healthcare, financial or real estate matters, such as property transactions, background credit checks with a credit bureau, and medical check-ups and reports where the failure to identify an individual accurately would pose a significant safety or security risk or significantly impact or harm the individual and/or the organisation."
"Why is the treatment of NRIC numbers applicable to other national identification numbers, such as Birth Certificate numbers, Foreign Identification Numbers (FIN) and Work Permit numbers?","Organisations, NRIC Numbers
","The treatment for NRIC numbers also applies to Birth Certificate numbers, FIN and Work Permit numbers that are issued by the Singapore Government, in view that they are also permanent and irreplaceable identifiers that bear similar risks as NRIC numbers if indiscriminately collected, used or disclosed."
Is the treatment of NRIC numbers applicable to passport numbers?,"Organisations, NRIC Numbers
","While passport numbers are periodically replaced, they too are important identification numbers that can serve the same purposes as the NRIC, FIN, Work Permit and Birth Certificate numbers. Therefore, organisations should accord passports similar treatment as that for NRICs, i.e. refrain from collecting passport numbers. If there is a need to collect, organisations should limit their collection to partial passport numbers and ensure an appropriate level of security to protect the passport numbers collected."
When can organisations retain an individual's physical NRIC?,"Organisations, NRIC Numbers
","Organisations should not retain an individual's physical NRIC unlessits retentionis required under the law. This is given the importance of the NRIC as a national identification document that is issued to all citizens and permanent residents of Singapore, and the impact to the individual should the physical NRIC be misplacedor stolen and used for illegal activities."
Is the treatment of the retention of the physical NRIC applicable to other identification documents (IDs) such as the driver's licence?,"Organisations, NRIC Numbers
","Yes, the positions taken for the retention of the physical NRIC apply to the retention of other IDs that contain the NRIC number (e.g. driver's licence, passport). This is because the risks associated with the indiscriminate retention of physical NRICs as collateral similarly apply to the retention of other IDs that contain the individuals' NRIC numbers. Organisations that wish to retain such IDs should only do so where it is required under the law, and put in place the appropriate security arrangements to protect the personal data in their possession or under their control."
Do the following situations constitute collection of personal data - for example:(a) checking the physical NRIC to verify the identity of an individual;(b) checking an individual's NRIC to verify his identity at point of entry into a particular place; and(c) checking an individual's NRIC to verify his age?,"Organisations, NRIC Numbers
","Where there is no intention to obtain control or possession of the physical NRIC in checking the NRIC for the purpose of establishing or verifying the identity of the individual, and no personal data is retained once the NRIC is returned immediately to the individual, the PDPC does not consider it to be collection of personal data."
"What alternatives should organisations use in place of NRIC numbers, physical NRIC or copies of the NRIC?","Organisations, NRIC Numbers
","The PDPC does not prescribe the types of identifiers that organisations should adopt in place of NRIC numbers. Organisations should assess the suitability of alternatives to NRIC numbers based on their own business and operational needs.However, some alternatives that have been adopted by organisations include organisation or user-generated ID, tracking number, organisation-issued QR code, or monetary deposit. Organisations should also consider whether the alternatives provided are reasonable, and avoid collecting excessive personal data."
Can organisations collect partial NRIC numbers?,"Organisations, NRIC Numbers
","The PDPC recognises that organisations may wish to collect partial NRIC numbers when other alternatives are not satisfactory. Organisations that collect the last three numerical digits and checksum of the NRIC number (e.g. ""567A"" from the full NRIC number of ""S1234567A"") would not be considered to be collecting the full NRIC number, and therefore not subject to the treatment for NRIC numbers set out in the PDPC's advisory guidelines. For more information on partial NRIC numbers, please refer to the PDPC's Technical Guide to Advisory Guidelines on the Personal Data Protection Act for NRIC and other National identification Numbers.Partial NRIC numbers are, however, considered personal data under the PDPA to the extent that an individual can be identified from the partial NRIC number, or from the number and other information to which the organisation has or is likely to have access. Organisations that collect partial NRIC numbers must still comply with the Data Protection Provisions of the PDPA, such as making reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data in their possession or under their control from unauthorised disclosure."
"Can organisations collect partial NRIC numbers of more than the last three numbers and checksum (e.g. ""4567A"" of ""S1234567A"")?","Organisations, NRIC Numbers
","Collecting more than the last three numerical digits and checksum increases the risk that the full NRIC number can be generated and correctly matched to an individual. Organisations should be mindful that more information could make it easier to re-identify an individual and therefore weigh the risks carefully against the need for collecting more information. Organisations that collect partial identification numbers must still comply with the Data Protection Provisions of the PDPA, such as making reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data in their possession or under their control from unauthorised disclosure."
"Can organisations that collect partial identification numbers include the first letter of the NRIC number (i.e. ""S"" of ""S1234567A"") or FIN (i.e. ""G"" of ""G1234567A"")?","Organisations, NRIC Numbers
","Collecting more information than the last three numbers and checksum of an individual's NRIC number of FIN increases the risk that the full NRIC number or FIN could be generated and correctly matched to the individual. For example, the first letter (e.g. S/T/F/G) provides additional information on the individual's citizenship, and the first two numbers of the NRIC number could also reveal the individual's birth year. This additional information could make it easier to identify an individual if collected. Organisations should therefore weigh the risks carefully against the need to include more information than the last three numbers and checksum of an individual's NRIC number of FIN. Organisations that collect partial identification numbers must still comply with the Data Protection Provisions of the PDPA, such as making reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data in their possession or under their control from unauthorised disclosure."
Can organisations randomly generate NRIC numbers?,"Organisations, NRIC Numbers
","An organisation that randomly generates a NRIC number (e.g. by applying an algorithm or using a validator to ascertain that the randomly generated number is a valid NRIC number) will be considered as having collected the NRIC number. The collection, use and disclosure of such numbers is subject to the treatment set out in the Advisory Guidelines on the PDPA for NRIC and other National Identification Numbers, i.e. organisations may not collect, use or disclose such numbers unless it is required by the law or necessary to accurately establish or verify the identity of the individualto a high degree of fidelity."
Can an organisation use the NRIC number as part of its system's user ID?,"Organisations, NRIC Numbers
","Organisations should not be using the full NRIC number as a user ID Organisations are to consider alternatives, and may refer to the Technical Guide to Advisory Guidelines on the PDPA for NRIC and Other National Identification Numbers."
"What if the individual chooses to use his NRIC number as a login/account ID or as a primary identifier, even if the organisation does not require it?","Organisations, NRIC Numbers
","Individuals are not prohibited from choosing to use their NRIC numbers as their preferred identifiers, for example, as their membership or login IDs. Individuals should make their own assessment of the risks associated while using their NRIC numbers for purposes that do not require it. Organisations are not expected to implement a form verification code toreject the NRIC numbers in online forms that allow individuals to type in free text."
What if an individual consents to the collection of his NRIC number?,"Organisations, NRIC Numbers
","In situations where the collection, use or disclosure of NRIC numbers is not required under the law or necessary to accurately establish or verify the identities of individuals to a high degree of fidelity, organisations should not collect an individual's NRIC number (or copy of NRIC). Consent obtained from the individual does not override the requirement for organisations to ensure the personal data is collected for purposes that are considered appropriate in the circumstance."
What should organisations do with the NRIC or other national identification numbers (or copies of ID) currently in their possession or control?,"Organisations, NRIC Numbers
",Organisations should review their existing business practices to ensure that their practices are aligned with the PDPC'sAdvisory Guidelines on NRIC numbers. This would include assessing whether the identification numbers (or copies of ID) in their possession or under their control are required under any law or necessary to accurately establish or verify the identity of the individual to a high degree of fidelity. Organisations should not keep the personal data after it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which the personal data was collected or for any legal or business purpose.Organisations that collect partial NRIC numbers containing more than the last three numerical digits and checksum of an individual's NRIC number (e.g. SXX34567A) should review their practices and assess whether they should collect just the last three numerical digits and checksum of the individual's NRIC number instead.Organisations will need to ensure that the necessary operational changes to business practices are made before 1 September 2019.
"Are organisations required to redact NRIC numbers in physical documents (e.g. hardcopy forms, certificates, letters) or unstructured data format (e.g. emails, digitalised documents in PDF) that had been previously collected?","Organisations, NRIC Numbers
","Organisations are not required to redact NRIC numbers that were collected orrecorded in physical documents or as unstructured data prior to 1 September 2019. From 1 September 2019, organisations should not request for NRIC numbers, regardless of the medium of collection, if it does not comply with the NRIC Advisory Guidelines.Given the risks and potential impact of unauthorised use or disclosure of personal data associated with NRIC numbers, organisations will be expected to provide a greater level of security to protect such information in their possession or under their control.In addition, organisations are reminded to cease the retention of all personal data through proper disposal or anonymisation when the purpose for collection is no longer served by the retention of the information and there is no business or legal need for them."
"What if organisations continue to collect, use and disclose NRIC numbers in circumstances that are not permitted after 1 September 2019?","Organisations, NRIC Numbers
","In the event that the PDPC receives a complaint on the collection, use or disclosure of NRIC numbers contrary to the positions set out in the PDPC's advisory guidelines after 1 September 2019, the PDPC will investigate the matter to establish whether there is a breach of the PDPA. In the event that the failure to adhere to the guidance provided results in a breach of the Data Protection Provisions, the penalties under the PDPA will apply."
Are there any schemes to help defray the cost of changing entire systems to use alternatives instead of NRIC numbers?,"Organisations, NRIC Numbers
","SMEs that would like to automate and align their operations with PDPC's updated Advisory Guidelines on NRIC numbers may consider adopting pre-approved solutions available at SME Portal Tech Depot, such as Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Point of Sales (PoS) and Visitor Management System (VMS) solutions, that allow the use of alternative identifiers apart from NRIC numbers.SMEs may apply for a Productivity Solutions Grant, which provides up to 70% funding support, administered by Enterprise Singapore."
"How can an organisation comply with the PDPC's NRIC Advisory Guidelines when the organisation is required to collect, use or disclose NRIC numbers for a public agency's purposes?","Organisations, NRIC Numbers
","As the issuing authority for the NRIC, the Government rightfully uses NRIC numbers to discharge its functions and services with citizens. An organisation that is required to collect, use or disclose NRIC numbers for a public agency's purposes is not required to assess whether the purposes are in accordance with the PDPC's NRIC Advisory Guidelines.Nonetheless, in such scenarios, organisations should inform the individuals that the collection, use or disclosure of their NRIC numbers is for purposes required by the public agency. Organisations are also reminded to ensure an appropriate level of security to protect the NRIC numbers collected. Organisations must also cease to retain the NRIC numbers once they have completed the tasks required by the public agency since the organisations have no need to retain the information.Organisations should note that the treatment for NRIC numbers also applies to Birth Certificate numbers, Foreign Identification Numbers (FIN), Work Permit numbers and Passport numbers."
Can commercial buildings or condominiums collect visitors' NRIC numbers for entry?,"Organisations, NRIC Numbers
","Property management and building owners should avoid collecting NRIC numbers and are encouraged to use alternative ways to address their requirements. For instance, organisations may consider checking a visitor's photo identification document and recording the visitor's full name and contact details (e.g. mobile number) or partial NRIC number where relevant."
"Are utility service providers or retailers (e.g. electricity retailers) allowed to collect, use or disclose individuals' NRIC numbers for the purpose of providing/facilitating utility services?","Organisations, NRIC Numbers
","An individual's NRIC number is likely to be necessary to accurately establish or verify an individual for the purposes of provisioning, porting or termination of essential services (e.g. electricity, water, gas). For example, if an individual closes an account with an electricity retailer, the inability to accurately identify the individual may pose a risk of significant impact or harm to the individual, given that the utility supply is essential for everyday living.Where organisations can collect NRIC numbers of individuals, they will have to comply with the Data Protection Provisions under the PDPA, such as ensuring an appropriate level of security to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure or similar risks, and ceasing to retain the data as soon as the purpose for which it was collected is no longer necessary for business or legal purposes."

For the purposes of the PDPA, a 'specified message' does not include any message referred to in the Eighth Schedule of the PDPA. Whether your organisation is directly sending such telemarketing messages, causing the message to be sent or authorising another organisation to do so, your organisation has to ensure compliance with the DNC provisions."
What does an organisation need to do in order to send marketing messages to Singapore telephone numbers?,"Organisations, Do Not Call Registry
","Before an organisation sends any marketing message to a Singapore telephone number, it should check that:the telephone number is not registered with the DNC Registry; the message it is sending contains clear and accurate information identifying the organisation, as well as its contact details; and  if making a phone call, the telephone number it is making the call from is not concealed.The DNC Registry contains three separate Registers of Singapore telephone numbers for voice calls, text messages (SMS/MMS/text) and faxes, which the organisation can check against. To check, the organisation shall submit a list of telephone numbers it is planning to send the messages to. The DNC Registry will then indicate, on the list, whether each number is in any of the Registers. The organisation may then send its marketing messages to the numbers that are not in the relevant Registers.The organisation may rely on the DNC Registry results for up to 30 days. If the organisation intends to send the marketing message after 30 days has lapsed, it must submit its list of numbers to the DNC Registry again."

Can an organisation continue to use a list of contacts obtained prior to 2 January 2014 for telemarketing purposes after the DNC provisions come into effect on 2 January 2014?,"Organisations, Do Not Call Registry
","If an organisation intends to carry out telemarketing activities to a pre-existing contact list obtained prior to 2 January 2014, the organisation must ensure that they comply with the DNC provisions of the PDPA. That is, before sending a telemarketing message to a Singapore telephone number, the organisation must check with the DNC Registry to confirm that the number is not listed on any of the DNC Registers, unless  it has obtained clear and unambiguous consent in written or other accessible form from the user/subscriber to the sending of the telemarketing message, or if the organisation can rely on the Personal Data Protection (Exemption from Section 43) Order 2013 to send the message or any other exclusions. This applies even if organisations are using Singapore telephone numbers they collected before the PDPA came into effect, and have been sending telemarketing messages to these numbers so far.
In addition to the DNC Registry provisions, organisations carrying out telemarketing activities should also comply with the data protection provisionsof the PDPA, which include seeking consent and informing individuals of the purposes for the collection, use and disclosure of personal data unless an exception applies. While, for purposes of the data protection provisions, organisations may use existing data collected before 2 Jul 2014 for the same purposes for which it was collected, organisations should cease doing so if individuals withdraws their consent or otherwise indicates that they do not consent the use of their personal data for such uses."
Do organisations have to check the DNC Registry for all telemarketing messages they intend to send out?,"Organisations, Do Not Call Registry

Can an organisation rely on the Exemption Order to continue sending telemarketing messages to an individual that it has an ongoing relationship with?,"Organisations, Do Not Call Registry
","An organisation that relies on the Personal Data Protection (Exemption from Section 43) Order 2013 to send promotional messages without checking the DNC Registry has to fulfil conditions. In brief: it must have an ongoing relationship with the subscriber or user;it must send a text or fax message (but not voice call);the purpose of the message must be related to the subject of their ongoing relationship with the subscriber or user; and it must provide an opt-out facility within the body of the message. The opt-out facility may be provided via a Singapore telephone number or short code (in the case of a text message), or a fax number (in the case of a fax message). When the subscriber or user opts out, the organisation can no longer rely on the exemption and must stop sending such messages to that individual's Singapore telephone number30 days after the individual has opted out.An organisation will not be able to rely on this exemption if the subscriber or user has withdrawn consent (and the prescribed period has lapsed) or indicated that he/she does not consent to the sending of any telemarketing message."

","Ongoing relationship' means a relationship, which is on an ongoing basis, between a sender and subscriber/user of a Singapore telephone number, arising from the carrying on or conduct of a business or activity (commercial or otherwise) by the sender. An ongoing relationship may include, for example, a subscription, membership, account, loan or comparable relationships involving the ongoing purchase or use of goods and services supplied by the sender to the individual.

For example, an overseas telecom service operator sending messages promoting their cheaper IDD service to Singapore subscribers roaming on the overseas telecom network will not need to check the DNC Registry."
Are business-to-business marketing calls or messages covered under the DNC Registry?,"Organisations, Do Not Call Registry
","A business-to-business (B2B) marketing call, SMS/MMS or fax message (B2B marketing message) refers to a marketing message which is sent to an organisation, for any purpose of the receiving organisation.A marketing message sent to an individual acting in a personal or domestic capacitywould not be considered a B2B marketing message, even if the message purports to be for a purpose of an organisation. B2B marketing messages are not within the scope of the DNC Registry. The PDPC recognises that B2B marketing calls or messages may be essential to the day-to-day operations between businesses and note that most consumers will not be affected by B2B marketing messages that are sent to organisations.Organisations may also register their business telephone numbers with the DNC Registry. To be clear, B2B marketing messages may stillbe sent to these registered business numbers if they are for a purpose of the organisation. An individual whose telephone or fax number is used as both a personaland business number may therefore still receive B2B marketing messages that are sent to his telephone or fax number as a business phone number."
Are telemarketing messages sent through applications such as WhatsApp covered under the DNC provisions?,"Organisations, Do Not Call Registry
","The DNC provisions apply to the sending of telemarketing messages addressed to Singapore telephone numbers registered with the DNC Registry. In situations where telemarketing messages are sent through smartphone applications that use a telephone number as an identifier, such as WhatsApp, such messages will be covered by the DNC provisions. Telemarketing messages sent via other technologies such as those using a mobile data connection will be treated similarly, as long as the message is addressed to a Singapore telephone number. However, some data-based phone applications do not use phone numbers as identifiers, and may use other identifiers such as email addresses instead. Telemarketing messages that are sent through such applications will not be covered by the DNC provisions."
Are emails and mail delivered by post covered under the DNC Registry?,"Organisations, Do Not Call Registry
","The DNC Registry covers marketing messages sent to Singapore telephone numbers. Emails and mail delivered by post are not included within the scope of the DNC Registry.Emails are not included within the scope of the DNC Registry as unsolicited emails can be blocked through email filters. They also cause less of a nuisance to delete when received, as compared to telephone calls, SMS and fax messages, which are more difficult for the individual to filter. Furthermore, the Spam Control Act (SCA) helps to complete the framework by setting out requirements in relation to the sending of unsolicited commercial electronic messages in bulk. Please refer to our FAQ on the SCA to find out more about the differences between the PDPA and the SCA. As for junk mail, there are existing ways for individuals to reduce the volume of such mail, such as through the use of letterboxes with anti-junk mail features. Junk mail may also be less of a nuisance than telephone calls, SMS or MMS messages, or faxes, which are more likely to inconvenience an individual or interrupt his activities."

The request may also be subject to the organisation's compliance with certain conditions as may be considered appropriate, which may include (without limitation) sealing of cabinets, keeping business records in the same state and place as when entry into the premises was effected, suspending external emails and allowing the inspector to remain in occupation of selected offices. The PDPC may immediately effect entry into an organisation's premises if the organisation's internal legal advisor is on site or if prior written notice had been given to the organisation."
"If an organisation has certain security policies such as the prohibition of entry to those with cameras or laptops, can the organisation stop the PDPC from bringing such items into its premises?","Organisations, Enforcement

In brief, the PDPA contains three main sets of data protection obligations:Obligations relating to notification, consent and purposeOrganisations must notify their purposes and obtain consent from individuals for the collection, use and disclosure of individuals' personal data.Obligations relating to compliance, accountability and access and correction Organisations must make information available about their data protection policies, appoint a data protection officer, give individuals access to their personal data (upon request) and allow individuals to correct their personal data (also upon request).Obligations relating to safeguarding personal data Organisation must: (i) comply with prescribed requirements when transferring personal data outside Singapore; (ii) use reasonable measures to protect personal data; (iii) make reasonable effort to ensure the accuracy of personal data; and (iv) cease to retain personal data when no longer required.The PDPA also provides for the establishment of a DNC Registry. The DNC Registry allows individuals to register their Singapore telephone numbers to opt out of receiving marketing phone calls, mobile text messages such as SMS or MMS, and faxes from organisations. You may refer to our website for more information on the data protection and DNC provisions."
What are the objectives of the PDPA?,"Individuals, General
","The PDPA aims to safeguard individuals' personal data against misuse by regulating the proper management of personal data. Generally, individuals have the right to be informed of the purposes for which organisations are collecting, using or disclosing their personal data, giving them more control over how their personal data is used.The PDPA also aims to enhance Singapore's competitive advantages as a location for data hosting and management activities by strengthening Singapore's reputation as a secure location for data and giving assurance to businesses looking for safeguards to protect sensitive data sets."
How does the PDPA benefit me?,"Individuals, General
","The law will ensure that organisations put in place safeguards to protect your personal data.  Organisations will generally be required to obtain consent for the collection, use and disclosure of personal data for their intended purposes, giving you more control over how your personal data is used."
How is the PDPA different from the Spam Control Act?,"Individuals, General
","The Spam Control Act (SCA) sets out a framework to manage unsolicited commercial electronic messages sent in bulk through electronic mail, text and multimedia messaging, otherwise known as ""spam"". The SCA requires organisations to, among others, provide an unsubscribe facility within the spam message and include a header in the subject field of the message or where there is no subject field, as the first words in the message.While the SCA manages the sending of spam messages, the PDPA sets out rules governing the proper collection, use and disclosure of personal data, which would include contact information of an individual. Under the PDPA, organisations are required to obtain consent for a stated purpose to collect, use or disclose the personal data of an individual, and safeguard such data, unless exceptions apply.In addition, the provisions relating to the DNC Registry in the PDPA allow individuals to opt out of marketing messages (voice calls, SMS/MMS or fax) delivered to a Singapore telephone number. Organisations are generally prohibited from sending marketing messages to Singapore telephone numbers registered with the DNC Registry unless they have obtained clear and unambiguous consent in written or other accessible form from the user/subscriber to the sending of the message, or if the organisation can rely on the Personal Data Protection (Exemption from Section 43) Order 2013 or any other exclusions. In relation to the sending of spam messages, the PDPA applies to the collection, use and disclosure of individuals' contact information for such purposes, while the SCA governs the manner in which the spam message may be sent. These frameworks will operate concurrently."
What is 'deemed' consent?,"Individuals, General
","An individual is deemed to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal data by an organisation if the individual voluntarily provides the personal data to the organisation for that purpose; and it is reasonable that he or she would do so.For example, an individual seeking medical treatment from a medical facility, such as a clinic or hospital, would voluntarily provide his or her personal data for such a purpose. He or she would be deemed to have consented to the collection and use of his or her personal data by the medical facility for that purpose."
What should organisations and individuals take note of in complying with withdrawal of consent requirements?,"Individuals, General
","There
are a number of requirements that both individuals and organisations need to
take note of. Some of these are: ·The individual must
give reasonable notice of the withdrawal to the organisation. As a general rule of
thumb, ten business days is considered to be reasonable notice.·On receipt of the
notice, the organisation must inform the individual of the likely consequences
of withdrawing consent. Consequences for withdrawal of consent could simply be
that the organisation would cease to collect, use or disclose the individual’s
personal data for the purpose specified by the individuals. However, if there
are other likely consequences, the organisation must also inform the individual
of those.·An organisation must
not prohibit an individual from withdrawing consent, although this does not
affect any legal consequences arising from such withdrawal.·Upon withdrawal of
consent, the organisation must cease (and cause its data intermediaries and agents
to cease) collecting, using or disclosing the personal data, as the case may
be, unless the collection, use or disclosure of the personal data without
consent is required or authorised under the PDPA or any other written law.Organisations
may provide in their marketing messages a facility for individuals to withdraw
their consent (e.g. by clicking on an “unsubscribe” link within an e-mail).
Organisations are encouraged to clearly indicate the scope of the withdrawal in
such instances. Organisations are also encouraged to inform individuals of how
they may withdraw consent for matters outside the scope of such withdrawal.In
some cases, individuals may provide organisations a general withdrawal notice
for marketing, i.e. it is not clear as to the channel of receiving marketing
messages for which consent is withdrawn. In such cases, the PDPC would consider
that any withdrawal of consent for marketing sent via a particular channel will
be considered to only apply to all messages relating to the withdrawal sent via
that channel."
What constitutes 'acting in personal or domestic capacity'?,"Individuals, General
","These are purposes to do with an individual's personal, family or household affairs. For example, when an individual keeps a database of his or her friends' and relatives' names, addresses, contact numbers and birthdates for his or her own personal use, he or she is considered to be acting in a personal or domestic capacity. His or her keeping of the database will not be covered under the PDPA."
What is 'business contact information'?,"Individuals, General
","Business contact information (BCI) refers to an individual's name, position name or title, business telephone number, business address, business electronic mail address or business fax number and any other similar information about the individual, not provided by him or her solely for personal purposes.Based on the above definition, BCI is excluded from the data protection provisions of the PDPA. Separately, the DNC provisions generally apply to all Singapore telephone numbers, unless  the organisation has obtained clear and unambiguous consent in written or other accessible form from the user/subscriber to the sending of the telemarketing message, or if the organisation can rely on the Personal Data Protection (Exemption from Section 43) Order 2013 or any other exclusions."
What can I do to protect my personal data?,"Individuals, General
","By being careful about how you manage your personal data, you can limit any potential risks of the misuse of your data. Some tips for protecting your personal data would include thinking about who you give your personal data to and why, being cautious about providing personal details to unsolicited callers, etc. Download a copy of our consumer handbook for tips to protect your personal data."
What can I do if there is a breach?,"Individuals, General
","If you come across a potential breach under the PDPA, you may contact the relevant organisation for clarifications. For further assistance, you may contact the PDPC at 6377 3131 or provide your feedback through our online form."
What can I expect from the PDPC with regard to my enquiry?,"Individuals, General
","The PDPC providesonly general information and clarification to enquiries. It is important to note that the PDPC does not provide legal or specific advice to your enquiry that may require a certain standard or decision from thePDPC to be made. Our response to your query is not asubstitute for legal advice, and is not legally binding on the PDPC or any other party. You may wish to engage independent legal advice if you are in doubt."
"Do organisations need to seek my consent before collecting, using and disclosing my personal data?","Individuals, Collection, Use, & Disclosure
","Organisations must obtain your consent to the collection, use or disclosure of your personal data, unless any exception under the PDPA applies. You may refer to the Second, Third and Fourth Schedules of the PDPA for a list of exceptions. You should also be notified of the purposes for the collection, use and disclosure of your personal data. In this regard, organisations shall not, as a condition of supplying a product or service, require you to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal data beyond what is reasonable to provide the product or service. For example, an organisation that sells a consumer product should not require you to reveal your annual household income as a condition of selling you the product, although it may still ask you to provide such personal data as an optional field.If the organisation wishes to collect any additional personal data, the organisation should provide you the option of whether to consent to this."
What can an organisation do with my personal data that is collected before the effective date of the data protection rules on 2 July 2014?,"Individuals, Collection, Use, & Disclosure
","Generally, organisations may continue to use the personal data collected prior to the effective date of the data protection rules, unless you withdraw your consent (if consent had previously been given) or indicate that you do not consent to such use of the personal data.  Consent will need to be obtained if the existing data is to be used for a new purpose different from the purpose for which it was collected, or if the existing data is to be disclosed to another organisation or individual, unless any exception applies. These exceptions are set out in the Second, Third and Fourth Schedules of the PDPA respectively. This includes exceptions catering to certain emergency situations, investigations, publicly available data or where the personal data is used for evaluative purposes.For example, if a company has been using your personal data to provide after-sales customer support prior to the PDPA, it can continue to do so after the PDPA comes into effect, even if it did not obtain consent previously. However, if it now intends to use the same personal data for direct marketing where it had not collected the personal data for this purpose, consent will need to be obtained for such a purpose. If the organisation wishes to use the personal data for telemarketing, it will separately have to ensure compliance with the DNC provisions under the PDPA. Generally, organisations may continue to use the personal data that was collected prior to the effective date of the data protection rules, for the reasonable purposes for which the personal data was collected."
Can the security guard of a private property estate or office building request for and collect the personal data (e.g. NRIC) of visitors before they enter the premises?,"Individuals, Collection, Use, & Disclosure
","Generally, the security guard should inform visitors of the purposes for the collection, use and disclosure of their personal data and obtain their consent. Even if the visitor does not expressly consent, if the visitor has been informed that his personal data is required for a particular purpose (for example, security purposes for entry into the premises), and he voluntarily provides the data, the visitor may be deemed to have given his consent to the collection, use or disclosure of his personal data for that purpose.The PDPA requires (amongst other things) that an organisation only collects, uses or discloses personal data for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances and also make reasonable security arrangements to protect personal data collected in order to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks."
Can I request access to my personal data held by an organisation?,"Individuals, Access & Correction
","You may request access to your personal data held by an organisation. However, there are exceptions such as legal professional privilege information and opinion data kept solely for evaluative purpose, among others. You may refer to the Fifth Schedule in the PDPA for the list of exceptions from the access requirement.In addition, organisations are prohibited from providing you access to the personal data if:it causes immediate or grave harm to your safety or physical or mental health; it threatens the safety or physical or mental health of another individual; it reveals personal data about another individual; it reveals the identity of the individual who has provided the personal data about you, and the individual has not consented to the disclosure of his or her identity; or it is contrary to national interest."
Can organisations charge a fee for my access request?,"Individuals, Access & Correction
","Organisations may charge a reasonable fee for access to personal data about an individual, to allow them to recover the incremental costs of responding to the access request. An example of such incremental cost is the cost of producing a physical copy of the personal data for an individual requesting it.  As organisations are required to make the necessary arrangements to provide for standard types of access requests, the costs incurred in capital purchases (for example, purchasing new equipment to provide access to the requested personal data) should not be transferred to individuals. The fee should also accurately reflect the time and effort required to respond to the request."
Can I request to correct my personal data held by an organisation?,"Individuals, Access & Correction
","You may request to correct an error or omission in the personal data an organisation holds about you. An organisation need not make a correction where it is satisfied on reasonable grounds that a correction should not be made. In this case, the organisation shall annotate the personal data in its possession or under its control with the correction that is requested but not made.  The organisation is generally required to send the corrected personal data to every other organisation to which the personal data was disclosed to within a year before the correction, unless the other organisation does not need the corrected personal data for any legal or business purpose, or if you have consented to the sending of corrected data only to specific organisations.  There are also exceptions to the correction requirement, such as if the personal data is opinion data kept solely for evaluative purposes. The list of exceptions may be found in the Sixth Schedule of the PDPA."
Can organisations charge a fee for my correction request?,"Individuals, Access & Correction
",Organisations are not entitled to impose a fee for the correction of personal data as required under the PDPA.
How long can an organisation retain my personal data?,"Individuals, Care of Personal Data
","The PDPA does not prescribe the retention period. However, an organisation shall cease to retain personal data as soon as the purpose of collection is no longer necessary for business or legal purposes."
Can I ask an organisation to delete my personal data from their records?,"Individuals, Care of Personal Data
","You may inform an organisation to stop collecting, using or disclosing your personal data at any time. However, the organisation is not required to delete or destroy your personal data and may retain it as long as there are business or legal needs."
How will the PDPA apply to my personal data overseas?,"Individuals, Care of Personal Data
","The PDPA applies to all personal data collected, used or disclosed in Singapore. As such, organisations that collect personal data overseas and host and/or process it in Singapore will still be subject to relevant obligations under the PDPA from the point that such personal data is brought into Singapore. For organisations that collect personal data here and transfer such data overseas, the PDPA requires that measures be put in place by the organisation here transferring the personal data, to provide a comparable standard of protection overseas. These measures include the use of contractual agreements among the organisations involved in the transfer, among others."
How can I ensure that an organisation has proper safeguards and measures in place to protect personal data in its care?,"Individuals, Care of Personal Data
","Organisations are required to make information about their personal data protection policies, practices and complaints processes available on request. In addition, organisations are required to publicly provide the business contact information of at least one person in the organisation to answer any personal data related queries or complaints.If you have concerns about how your personal data is being handled, you may approach the respective organisation to provide clarity on their data protection policies and practices."
"When can organisations collect, use or disclose my NRIC number (or copy of my NRIC)?","Individuals, NRIC Numbers
","Organisations are generally not allowed to collect, use or disclose your NRIC number (or copy of your NRIC). They may do so only if it is required under the law (or an exception under the PDPA applies) or necessary to accurately establish or verify your identity to a high degree of fidelity."
Is the treatment of NRIC numbers applicable to other identification numbers?,"Individuals, NRIC Numbers
","The treatment for NRIC numbers also applies toother national identification numbers such asBirth Certificate numbers, Foreign Identification Numbers (FIN) and Work Permit numbers that are issued by the Singapore Government, in view that they are also permanent and irreplaceable identifiers that bear similar risks as NRIC numbers if indiscriminately collected, used or disclosed."
Is the treatment of NRIC numbers applicable to passport numbers?,"Individuals, NRIC Numbers
","While passport numbers are periodically replaced, they too are important identification numbers that can serve the same purposes as the NRIC, FIN, Work permit and Birth Certificate numbers. Therefore, organisations should accord passports similar treatment as that for NRICs ie.e refrain from collecting passport numbers. If there is a need to collect, organisations should limit their collection to partial passport numbers and ensure an appropriate level of security to protect the passport numbers collected."
When can an organisation retain my physical NRIC?,"Individuals, NRIC Numbers
","Organisations should not retain your physical NRIC unless required under the law. This is given the importance of the NRIC as a national identification document that is issued to all citizens and permanent residents of Singapore, and the impact to the individual should the NRIC be misplaced or stolen and used for illegal activities."
Is the treatment of the retention of the physical NRIC applicable to other identification documents (IDs) such as my driver's licence?,"Individuals, NRIC Numbers
","Yes, the positions taken for the retention of the physical NRIC apply to the retention of other IDs that contain the NRIC number (e.g. driver's licence, passport). This is because the risks associated with the indiscriminate retention of physical NRICs as collateral similarly apply to the retention of other IDs that contain NRIC numbers. Organisations that wish to retain such IDs should only do so where it is required under the law, and put in place the appropriate security arrangements to protect the personal data in their possession or under their control."
Do the following situations constitute collection of personal data - for example:(a) checking my NRIC to verify my identity at point of entry into a particular place; and(b) checking my NRIC to verify my age?,"Individuals, NRIC Numbers
","Where there is no intention to obtain control or possession of your physical NRIC for the purpose of establishing or verifying your identity, and no personal data is retained once the NRIC is immediately returned to you, the PDPC does not consider it to be a collection of personal data."
Can organisations collect partial NRIC numbers?,"Individuals, NRIC Numbers
","The PDPC recognises that organisations may wish to collect partial NRIC numbers when other alternatives are not satisfactory. Organisations that collect the last three numerical digits and checksum of the NRIC number (e.g. ""567A"" from the full NRIC number of ""S1234567A"") would not be considered to be collecting the full NRIC number, and therefore not subject to the treatment for NRIC numbers set out in the PDPC's advisory guidelines.Partial numbers are, however, considered personal data under the PDPA to the extent that an individual can be identified from the partial NRIC number, or from the number and other information to which the organisation has or is likely to have access. Organisations that collect partial NRIC numbers must still comply with the Data Protection Provisions of the PDPA, such as making reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data in their possession or under their control from unauthorised disclosures."
Can organisations randomly generate NRIC numbers?,"Individuals, NRIC Numbers
","An organisation that randomly generates a NRIC number (e.g. by applying an algorithm or using a validator to ascertain that the randomly generated number is a valid NRIC number) will be considered as having collected the NRIC number. The collection, use and disclosure of such numbers is subject to the treatment set out in the Advisory Guidelines on the PDPA for NRIC and other National Identification Numbers, i.e. organisations may not collect, use or disclose such numbers unless it is required by the law or necessary to accurately establish or verify the identity of the individualto a high degree of fidelity."
Can I choose to use my NRIC number as a login/account ID or as a primary identifier with an organisation?,"Individuals, NRIC Numbers
","You may choose to use your NRIC number as a preferred identifier, for example, as your membership or login ID. You should make your own assessment of the risks associated with using your NRIC number for the purposes that do not require it."
"When must organisations stop collecting, using and disclosing my NRIC number, if they are no longer supposed to do so?","Individuals, NRIC Numbers
",Organisations will need to ensure that the necessary operational changes to business practices are made before 1 September 2019.
"What if organisations continue to collect, use or disclose my NRIC number in circumstances that are not permitted after 1 September 2019?","Individuals, NRIC Numbers
","In the event that an organisation collects, uses or discloses your NRIC number contrary to the positions set out in the PDPC's advisory guidelines after 1 September 2019, you may lodge a complaint with the PDPC. We will investigate the matter to establish whether there is a breach of the PDPA. If the failure to adhere to the guidance provided results in a breach of the Data Protection Provisions, the penalties under the PDPA will apply."
Can commercial buildings or condominiums collect my NRIC number as a visitor? ,"Individuals, NRIC Numbers
","Property management and building owners should avoid collecting NRIC numbers and are encouraged to use alternative ways to address their requirements. For instance, organisations may consider checking a visitor's photo identification document and recording the visitor's full name and contact details (e.g. mobile number), or partial NRIC number where relevant."
"Are utility providers or retailers (e.g. electricity retailers) allowed to collect, use or disclose my NRIC number (or copy of my NRIC) for the purpose of providing/facilitating utility services?","Individuals, NRIC Numbers
","YourNRIC number is likely to be necessary to accurately establish or verify your identity for the purposes of provisioning, porting or termination of essential services (e.g. electricity, water, gas).

Furthermore, the Spam Control Act (SCA) helps to complete the framework by setting out requirements in relation to the sending of unsolicited commercial electronic messages in bulk. Please refer to our FAQ on the SCA to find out more about the differences between the PDPA and the SCA.  As for junk mail, there are existing ways for individuals to reduce the volume of such mail, such as through the use of letterboxes with anti-junk mail features.
